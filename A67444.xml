         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>And yet I acknowledge withall, that hitherto I have not ſeen any ſufficient Motive, to perſwade me, that the <hi>Perſon of Quality</hi> had not a farr other deſign, in altering or declining, in his A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But however this be, I can boldly averr, not to your Grace only, but to all the World, that my own deſign in taking notice of this Gentleman's Book againſt me (though not ſo much againſt me, as againſt the whole Body, and even every Individual apart, of <hi>Iriſh</hi> Catholicks) is no other, than to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie (as well as I may) that which I purſued all along in my former Writings to your Grace, <hi>My moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble request of your just and merciful regard of the poor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>streſſed Catholick People of</hi> Ireland: Without intending any kind of injuſtice, much leſs rigour, or unmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to their Adverſaries, not even to this <hi>Perſon of Quality himſelf;</hi> but remembring ſtill to check, as much as in me lyes, and not in my ſelf alone, but in others, all temptations to the contrary, and as well in relation to him, and his People, or Party, as to the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> with that moſt Chriſtian advice (whereof, as <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 21.</note> being the great Apoſtles, I humbly minded your Grace before now, in my <hi>Iriſh Colours Folded) Vince in bono malum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for any thing elſe, I have not much to ſay here. For albeit the Title of a Dedicatory, and the <hi>Duke of Ormond</hi>'s Name prefix'd, might invite a more ſprightly Genius than mine, to make uſe of all the Flouriſhes of Oratory, and Embelliſhments of Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and of all its Metaphors, and other Gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties, and thoſe finer Words, and quainter Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and of even all the moſt raviſhing and ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Digreſſions anſwerable; yet conſidering the <hi>Duke</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:38030:4"/> 
               <hi>of Ormond</hi>'s Name is more famed already than my weak Eſſayes can make it, and his Merits greater than ſo mean a Panegyriſt is able to ſet forth, I will not bring upon my ſelf Imprecations, by attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to obſcure the Meridian Glory of the Sun by over-caſting it.</p>
            <p>And therefore, my Lord, I will only add what is more ſuitable to my own Genius, and more proper to the ſubject of this Book, which I moſt humbly preſent, and what I believe alſo will be more accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to your Grace, than a ſpeech of your own praiſe, though penn'd by any the moſt eloquent <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> or <hi>Cicero</hi> of any Age.</p>
            <p>It is, my Lord, that I plead for a People, of whom King <hi>James's Attorney General in</hi> Ireland, nine and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years agoe, in that excellent Piece of his, entitled by himſelf, <hi>A Diſcovery of the State of</hi> Ireland, and by himſelf Dedicated to his Majeſty, hath given this general Character, according to his own very able judgement, much knowledge in their Hiſtory, and long abode in their Country; and given it in the very laſt Page, and very laſt words of that Page of his Book; after he had immediately before ſaid, that the whole Iſland, from Sea to Sea, had been reduced to his Majeſties peaceable poſſeſſion, and under his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate protection. <note n="*" place="margin">The Author of the Book, ſtiled, <hi>A Diſcovery of the State of</hi> Ireland, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Pag. 286, and Pag. 287.</note> 
               <hi>In which condition of Subjects</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>they will gladly continue, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, or adhering to any other Lord or King, as long as they may be protected, and juſtly governed, without oppreſsion on the one ſide, or impunity on the other. For there is no Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of People under the Sun, that doth love equal and indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Juſtice better than the</hi> Iriſh, <hi>or will rest better ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the execution thereof, although it be againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſo as they may have the protection and benefit of the Law, when upon juſt cauſe they do deſire it.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:38030:4"/>
            <p> And it is further (my Lord) that I plead yet more particularly for a People, who are ſufficiently known to have preſerved, and our of their natural affection to the true <hi>Engliſh</hi> Intereſt, and ſelf-preſervation by that Intereſt, and out of a Conſcience too of their obligation, by all the Laws of God and Man, to be loyal Sbjects to his moſt ſacred Majeſty, who only is the ſupreme and moſt proper Judge of that Intereſt, to have ſo preſerved the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> in the late Wars, from being alienated from the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and from his Majeſty, to a powerful Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reiner, and whoſe Anceſtors, in <hi>Tirones</hi> Rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and in ſo many preceding Revolutions, during the fatal Diviſions of <hi>Lancaster</hi> and <hi>York,</hi> under <hi>Henry</hi> the 6. and in the Barons Wars, in King <hi>John</hi>'s Reign, as likewiſe in all other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions (which have been but too frequent ſince the firſt Conqueſt by <hi>Henry</hi> the Second) are famous in Chronicles for having mantain'd, and commonly at their own private charges, and their own private ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard alone, the very ſame true <hi>Engliſh</hi> Intereſt in that Nation. But if notwithſtanding two ſuch weighty conſiderations (beſides thoſe many other given your Grace, not in this Work only, but alſo in my two former Addreſſes) the Catholicks of <hi>Ireland</hi> muſt be eternally miſerable; and if it be ſo decreed, that theſe poor People muſt be utterly deſtroyed, and at this time too, and by the very impreſſion of King <hi>Charles</hi>'s the no leſs <hi>Juſt</hi> than <hi>Merciful's</hi> Royal Hand and Seal, and by the very concurrence of the <hi>Duke of Ormond,</hi> and as well by occaſion of their moſt loyal endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, or of having fought conſtantly for ſo many years, while any fighting was in any of the three Kingdoms, for his Majeſty, as upon account of thoſe other, which they have long ſince re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Which was the reaſon, together with that reſentment every good Patriot ſhould have, I writ to my Friends in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and ſuch as were likelyeſt to know, whether any one had thought of a Reply, or whether they all did give the Perſon of Quality's Anſwer for un-anſwerable. At last, after much enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and pains taken in this Buſineſs, and ſome Charges too, it pleaſed God I ſhould receive a Manuſcript Copy of this you have here. And though I know not the Author, but by report, nor understand the reaſon why he would not do his Country right, in appeaſing this strom; which had been raiſed to ſo great a height, by occaſion partly of his own former Writings, in behalf of his diſtreſsed Countrymen; albeit that could be no juſt occaſion, either for this Perſon of Quality, or the Man in the Dark in <hi>England</hi> (who writ formerly againſt him, <hi>The Iriſh Colours diſplayed,</hi> and whom <hi>P.

And in truth the late evil times have been guilty of ſo many changes, and men have been ſo dexterous, and ſo ſupple in their natures, to make application to the thriving ſide, that we may not wonder to ſee both the Art it ſelf, and the Oratory that beſt ſuits with it, in ſo long a tract of time, and ſo many Viciſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, brought to perfection.</p>

And I can imagine no other reaſon for it, but that being himſelf deſirous to expoſe the Duke of <hi>Ormond</hi> to the obloquy and diſtruſt of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and not daring to appear bare-fac'd in ſo foul a practice, he vented his own Conceptions by fathering them upon another, and was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to give his Grace the blow, although he look'd aſquint on me. If this be to <hi>betray with a kiſs, and by undermining,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pag. 6.</note> the guilt muſt lye at the Gentleman's own door: For he muſt excuſe me, if I do not lend him my Paw, to rake the Cheſnuts out of the Embers.</p>
            <p n="15">15. As for my <hi>affection</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> whereat, in the next place, this Gentleman has a fling, though he <note place="margin">Pag. 6.</note> confeſs (but either forgetfully or wilfully) I ſaid no more in my Letter, for that in particular, than I ſaid in general, for my Countrymens having a right to the Peace made in 1648. I am content his Grace takes his meaſure of it by his knowledge of my endeavours that all my Countrymen ſhould obſerve that Peace with the greateſt Punctuality, Religion, and Sincerity imaginable. And ſo the Gentleman hath his <hi>belief</hi> herein confirmed by my conſent. But in as much as he ſeems to take it ill, that in my Letter I gave him no more ground than he will underſtand I have, to vent his paſſion againſt my <hi>affection,</hi> I profeſs to him now, and to all the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:38030:15"/> World, that my affection hath been as great, as good, as conſtant, as paſſionate, as truly loyal, and as religiouſly Chriſtian, in all reſpects, to his Grace, ſince ever I had the firſt honour of his acquaintance, as my Letter expreſſed it to be <hi>unalterable.</hi> That I have given ſince that time, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time, invincible arguments thereof; and thoſe too known to thouſands, Friends and Foes (amongſt whom I could number ſome, peradventure of this Perſon of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity's Friends heretofore, <hi>Ludlow,</hi> and <hi>Jones,</hi> and <hi>Corbet,</hi> ſometimes Commiſſioners in <hi>Ireland,</hi> under the Uſurpers; beſides others of greateſt rank in <hi>England,</hi> in the dayes of Anarchy, under the young Protector <hi>Cromwell,</hi> and the Committee of Safety: And I could call even <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and as far as <hi>Madrid,</hi> and the greateſt Miniſters of State to the Catholick King, to witneſs. And yet have given ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible arguments hereof, as the Duke of <hi>Ormond</hi> himſelf will (I doubt not) if occaſion require, acknowledge to have been ſuch, and own both them and me as ſuch.</p>
            <p n="16">16. The next Battery is rais'd againſt that part of my Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which this Gentleman calls my <hi>Petition,</hi> and immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a looſe ſhot is made to ſhew that I am ſtruck <hi>with the jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies and fears of my Countrymen,</hi> limiting the Duke of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>'s <note place="margin">Pag. 6.</note> aſſiſtance to the preſent Conjuncture. Certainly no indifferent Perſon will think this to be precipitation or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt in me, when he underſtands that the Bill of Settlement was then tranſmitted hither to his Majeſty, and that an Act of Parliament once paſt concludes all Intereſts.</p>
            <p n="17">17. Here I ſhall beg this favour of the Reader, that he may not judge it eſſential for his Satisfaction, that I ſhould purſue every flaſh of wit, that, like ſparkles in a new kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Char-coal fire, breaks from this Gentleman: And that he deferr giving this <hi>of Articling firſt, and breaking of Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi>

            <p n="19">19. He will not allow of what I ſay of the Catholicks putting themſelves <hi>freely</hi> into his Graces hands. He will have the word <hi>freely</hi> reſtrain'd here, without any reaſon, <note place="margin">Pag. 7.</note> to his own meaning, and only to ſignifie <hi>gratis,</hi> againſt all the Rules of Divinity, Philoſophy, Oratory, Hiſtory, Grammar; againſt the nature or impoſed ſignification of the word in it ſelf; againſt the acception of men, even of the vulgar; againſt that which the Antecedents, and Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents, and middle, and all parts of my Letter, duely pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, can make it import; and no leſs againſt my intention, abundantly and rationally expreſſed, not by this word alone, but in the whole contexture of that innocent Piece of mine. For all underſtanding men know, that the word <hi>freely</hi> cannot of it ſelf, or without ſome reſtriction or limitation by the matter treated of, or by other adjuncts, be more, if not rather much leſs, reſtrained to ſignifie either merit, or equivalency, or other anſwerable thing by pact, than to expreſs a meer ſpontaneous inclination, and election, at leaſt without force impoſed on the party ſo determining. And the whole diſcourſe, argument, and final ſcope of that Letter, ſhew evidently that my intention there by the word <hi>freely,</hi> was no other than to expreſs a ſtrong inclination, or deſire, and a <hi>freedom</hi> of will, and voluntary action of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Confederates, for as much as related to them, in concluding that Peace: Or (at moſt) to expreſs that <hi>freedom</hi> which is not leſſen'd by external force, coacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or violence. For could it have been rationally ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, that I, who in every other line do mention the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Peace, ſhould be ſo fooliſhly impudent, as to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verr, that the King granted nothing? What is more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent than, if you delay to perform your promiſe given up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pact, to allege, that I did <hi>freely</hi> put my ſelf into your hands?</p>
            <p n="20">20. But to do this Perſon of Quality right, I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, he doth not abſolutely averr the word <hi>freely</hi> in that <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> of mine to ſign fie <hi>gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

If <hi>this,</hi> does not he betray his want of judgement and knowledge?</p>
            <p n="21">21. Yet in the next Page he muſt proſecute an errour by adding to it an impoſture. <hi>That</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>which his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi>

I grant his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty in his gracious Declaration of the <hi>30th.</hi> of <hi>Novem.</hi> 1660. Page 3. has theſe words, <hi>We well remember the Ceſſation of the Peace; which our Royal Father of bleſſed memory had been forced, during the late troubles, to make with his</hi> Iriſh <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of that our Kingdom, and by which he was compelled to give them a full pardon for what they had before done amiſs, upon their return to their duty, and their promiſe to give his Majeſty a vigorus aſſiſtance.</hi> And ſoon after in the ſame Page theſe other words, <hi>We could not forget the Peace which Our ſelves was after neceſſitated to make with our ſaid Subjects, in the time when they who wickedly uſurp'd the Authority, had erected that odious Court for the taking away the life of Our dear Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> &amp;c. And I further grant all the advantages he can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive from that paſſage of mine, <hi>But withall, my Lord, I ſhall give your Excellence my moſt earneſt and moſt humble de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, that you delay no longer, than ſhall be neceſſary, to clear thoſe clouds of darkneſs, and clear them in this preſent conjuncture, by an effectual demonſtration of that juſtice and favour you intended the Catholicks of</hi> Ireland <hi>in your Articles of</hi> 48. <hi>when they ſo freely put themſelves and their power into your hands.</hi> And what then? muſt it follow, that <hi>That which his Majeſty calls forced, compelled, and neceſſitated,</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:38030:17"/> P. W. <hi>calls freely putting themſelves into his Graces hands?</hi> By what Rule of Logick I wonder? I am ſure not by thoſe of Oppoſition, either of Contraries, or Contradictories, or by any other than that of this Gentleman's <hi>Disparaeta,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven that by which he might as well argue and conclude <hi>Deus eſt in Coelo, ergo baculus eſt in angulo.</hi> His Majeſty ſayes, that both his Father of bleſſed memory, and himſelf have been <hi>forced:</hi> And I ſay the Confederate Catholicks have been <hi>free,</hi> and thoſe and theſe are not the Same, but very Different things: And Oppoſition muſt be in the very ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame thing. Muſt it not follow therefore, that our Perſon of Quality's Concluſion is <hi>from the Staffe to the Corner</hi> (as they ſay)?</p>
            <p n="22">22. But to let the Reader ſee this Gentleman's Ethicks are no better than his Logick (his blind Zeal, or a worſe Paſſion, equally confounding his Judgement here and there) let us grant him what he cannot prove, nor has any kind of colour to allege, that I had ſaid his Majeſty was <hi>free</hi> in concluding that Peace, muſt it therefore have followed, that I contradict or oppoſe his moſt ſacred Majeſties expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons above related? Or that I ſaid his Father of bleſſed me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory was not forced to the Ceſſation, or himſelf to that Peace? Surely this Gentlemah hath forgot his Morals, if he think ſo; or if he think not ſo, he muſt ſpeak againſt his Conſcience, by fixing that on me, whereof he knows me unguilty. But however this be, can he deny there are four kinds of <hi>Freedom</hi> diverſly imported by the word <hi>freely;</hi> one from intrinſick neceſſity, or natural undeliberation, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe called <hi>Freedom of election or indifferency;</hi> another from extrinſick (that is from coaction, violence, force, or compulſion, derived from external cauſes, whether natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral or free;) a third from both; and a fourth yet from the more violent kinds of outward force, neceſſity, or coacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, impoſed or uſed by men, though not from thoſe other kinds that are not ſo preſſing? Or can he deny the firſt to be <hi>eſſentially</hi> and <hi>ſimply</hi> ſuch, ſpecially in relation to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond? Or this to be <hi>accidental</hi> only, and <hi>ſecundùm quid,</hi> or in a certain diminutive ſenſe in reſpect of that, and in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to internal, deliberate, or voluntary conſent, or
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:38030:17"/> diſſent, or even to external operations proceeding from them? Can he maintain the word <hi>Freedom</hi> to be ſolely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to that which is from both internal and external neceſſity or coaction, in the whole latitude of this word <hi>Coaction,</hi> or in the ſenſe of it, imports that which is <hi>by</hi> and <hi>from</hi> another man, and which moreover amounts to the actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al reſtraint of ones perſon, or danger of his life? Or will he maintain the Merchant, who in a ſtorm caſts over-board his goods to ſave his life, does not act with that <hi>freedom</hi> and voluntarineſs, that is primarily, eſſentially and ſimply ſuch, or ſuch as may denominate him in that caſe <hi>freely</hi> acting, as to this ejection of his goods, though he act withall <hi>ſecundùm quid,</hi> or in ſome degree, or ſome ſenſe <hi>unfreely,</hi> or unvo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily? Or likewiſe maintain, that his Majeſties meaning was by the words <hi>forced, compelled, neceſſitated,</hi> to ſignifie that he had not, in concluding with the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> that eſſential or inward <hi>freedom,</hi> which is called <hi>freedom,</hi> or liberty of election, or indifferency, and which only excludes inward neceſſity, or natural undeliberation? Or even to ſignifie that he had not, moreover that kind alſo of outward <hi>free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> which is only from the more violent ſorts of external Coaction, <hi>viz.</hi> from corporal reſtraint, or danger of death, or any other ſuch violent compulſion (if any ſuch other be) that invalidates Agreements made betwixt a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Prince, and his Subjects in Armes againſt him? If our Perſon of Quality cannot maintain theſe, or deny thoſe as is evident to all judicious knowing men, he cannot; then muſt it be no leſs evident, that even, in caſe I had ſaid in my Letter, that his Majeſty had (on the other ſide) <hi>freely</hi> Commiſſion'd my Lord Duke of <hi>Ormond</hi> for tranſacting that Peace, and <hi>freely</hi> conſented to, and <hi>freely</hi> approved of, and ratified the whole tranſaction, when concluded (as without any peradventure his Majeſty has) I had ſpoken as truly, ſignificantly, and properly, and without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction or oppoſition to his Majeſties related expreſſious, as I did in ſaying the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks of <hi>Ireland</hi> had <hi>freely put themſelves into my Lord of</hi> Ormond<hi>'s hands.</hi> Yea, and without any ſuch compariſon (leſt this Perſon of Quality ſuſpect what I intend not) had ſpoken a very known truth,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:38030:18"/> and a truth no way contradicting or oppoſing thoſe paſſages of his moſt ſacred Majeſties Declaration. For who is ſo blind, as not to ſee, that with this kind of accidental un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freedom (imported by the words <hi>forced, compelled, neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitated)</hi> that liberty or freedom which is primarily, eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and ſimply ſuch; That which renders our actions mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, humane, obliging in Conſcience, vertuous or vicious before God; That which gives force to contracts and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments before men, doth conſiſt? Or who underſtands not that this kind of liberty which denominates actions (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding thence) <hi>ſimpliciter liberas voluntarias</hi> (albeit they may be at the ſame time <hi>ſecundùm quid involuntariae)</hi> hath no oppoſite, but intrinſick neceſſity, undeliberation, or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural inconſiderancy? Or that the liberty and freedom I would have had in our ſuppoſition, aſſerted to have been in his Majeſty, could have no other oppoſite, but either that intrinſick neceſſity alone, or with it, or without it, that more violent kind of extrinſick force, to wit, perſonal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, or danger of ones life? And conſequently, that as there is no oppoſition 'twixt external force, und intrinſick liberty, or 'twixt any other leſſer, or milder kind of exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal neceſſity, force, compulſion, and being <hi>free</hi> from bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily reſtraint, or danger of death only: So there muſt be none 'twixt his Majeſties being <hi>forced, compelled,</hi> or <hi>neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated,</hi> as above, and his being <hi>ſimply free</hi> (nevertheleſs) in giving the Commiſſion-Royal to conclude that Peace, and in ratifying after what was concluded.</p>
            <p n="23">23. I confeſs notwithſtanding, that if the coaction from External Cauſes (I mean from other men) be ſuch as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive one of his Corporal liberty, or to endanger inevitably, or notoriouſly, the life of another, whom they would force by ſuch means to condeſcend to ſome Pacts or Concorda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tums; in this caſe, the Laws and the conſent of Nations, and natural reaſon dictate the reſciſſion of them. Whence it is that the conſent of his late Majeſty in the <hi>Iſle of Wight,</hi> had he given any, as he did not to the then Parliament, might and ought to be reſcinded. But withall I affirm, that Princes are not by any other obvious neceſſity impoſed upon them by diſobedient or diſloyal Subjects, excuſed from perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:38030:18"/> agreements, howſoever otherwiſe <hi>forced, compelled, or neceſſitated they be;</hi> provided the Covenants be not againſt the Laws of God and Nature. For this being denyed, what ſhould the Plea of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> or <hi>Charta de Foreſta,</hi> avail the Barons, that forced both from King <hi>John?</hi> What ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny pacifications throughout the World? So many Acts of Indempnity, Modern or Antient, Forein or Domeſtick, which Princes would not (at leaſt in the Latitude they were in) have aſſented to, had not the Rebellious Contumacy of their Subjects <hi>forced, compelled, and neceſſitated</hi> them?</p>
            <p n="24">24.

As for the Printing of one of the Petitions, and the Elogies, I ſtood in the Croud, when a ſmart Anſwer was given by Mr. <hi>Gerott Moore,</hi> at the Council Board, to a Nobleman, that belike hath printed ſomewhat of a higher nature than this concerning <hi>Cromwell,</hi> yet inſiſted very much upon the Title given the Rump in that printed Petition.</p>
            <p n="48">48. Now having allowed this Gentleman all the words himſelf could imagine to be in a Pet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p n="49">49. Here is firſt to be obſerved, that the Petition ſayes, <note place="margin">Pag. 20.</note> 
               <hi>they do willingly acquieſce in the Tranſplantation, albeit it was not executed by any legal power.</hi> This which of its own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is an <hi>execution</hi> in a Civil matter, is converted to an <hi>exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution</hi> upon a Scaffold. Moreover admitting his own words, that no execution was legal, that was not derived from the Rump, even this cannot prove his inference: For although we grant that no execution was legal that was not derived from the Rump; yet this concludes not, that all executions were legal that were derived from their Power. However, rather than fail, he would compel the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Catholicks to inveſt in the Rump a greater infallibility than they give the Pope.</p>
            <p n="50">50. But to ſay the truth, I think he believed the general negative, and the general affirmative were of equal exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. However, to underceive him for the future, he may be pleaſed to read his Errour in theſe Propoſitions and Inferences. No Executions are legal that do not iſſue out of the Kings Courts; therefore all Executions are legal that iſſue out of the Kings Courts. No man is a perfect States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that hath not ſeen forein Countries, and known forein Aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:38030:26"/> ſeen forein Countries, and known forein Affairs. No man goes to Heaven, but he that is baptized; therefore all men goe to Heaven that are baptized. The Man in the dark in <hi>England</hi> was pleaſed to entertain me with much bitterneſs: and this Gentleman of Quality in <hi>Ireland</hi> gives me this Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick to boot.</p>
            <p n="51">51. If all this do not ſatisfie this Perſon of Quality's very ſcrupulous Conſcience againſt theſe Petitions, he is briefly anſwer'd, That the Tranſplanted Perſons, and generality of <hi>Iriſh</hi> Catholicks, openly diſown thoſe Petitions, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Commiſſion from themſelves, impowering, in that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, thoſe Gentlemen; albeit, without any queſtion, they being employed to petition againſt the Oath of Abjura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and other Oppreſſions of their Countrymen (not to eſtabliſh that of Tranſplantation) their endeavours even in this particular, as matters were then, proceeded from their deſires to ſerve them. Neither doth the <hi>continuance of theſe two Gentlemen,</hi> ſince that time, in their publik employment for the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Catholicks, prove what this Perſon of Quality labours in the <hi>22th.</hi> Page of his Book, or that all they did or do is <hi>by allowance or command from their Countrymen.</hi> It is well known the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Catholicks never gave them any ſuch general power, much leſs a particular allowance or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for this, which indeed few or none of them either knew, heard, or thought of, untill ſome few did of late, by reading this Gentleman's Book.</p>

For if the Kingdom be to be enriched with traffick, and that encreaſing of the publick wealth be a principal point of State-policy, it is evident that moſt of the Corporations of <hi>Ireland</hi> are grown deſpicably poor by excluding the Natives from free commerce and traffique, and that the little life which is yet preſerv'd in negotiation, is maintained by the trade they drive a Factors to thoſe that live in thoſe Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.

For if he ſhould inſtance any other before that, his allegation would be impertinent
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:38030:30"/> againſt me, even as to ſuch, or to overthrow the Articles of that Peace. And I ſay moreover, that whatever the tranſgreſſions of the ſaid three, and, if you pleaſe, add three more, diſobedient Corporations have been, I am ſure they amount not to the Crimes of thoſe other Towns, poſſeſſed, even at that time in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and ever ſince the beginning of the Wars to this very day, by <hi>Engliſh</hi> Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants (ſuch, I mean, as went under that Notion) which a Perſon of as great Quality as this Gentleman, either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred with, or induced to manifeſt Rebellion, and inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable Treachery (both without any compariſon ſurmount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the tranſgreſſions of <hi>Galway, Limerick,</hi> and <hi>Waterford)</hi> even to fall away openly from his Grace, and from his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and turn profeſſed Enemies to both, even to declare for <hi>Cromwell,</hi> and the long Parliament, and receive in their Forces, long before <hi>Galway, Limerick,</hi> and <hi>Waterford</hi> can be ſaid to have been guilty of any of the tranſgreſſions, true or falſe, charged upon them; and even (I ſay) to receive thoſe Enemy-Forces without any kind of neceſſity; nay to declare for them, even before they had ſeen an Enemy come within ſixſcore miles of them, nay to have made their bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain with them before <hi>Cromwell</hi> ſet his foot on <hi>Iriſh</hi> ground. And I am yet further certain, that however <hi>Waterford, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merick,</hi> and <hi>Galway</hi> tranſgreſſed, their guilt cannot in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice render the generality of other Corporate places guilty, nor conſequently forfeitable; much leſs the generality of the Catholick people, or Proprietors of Eſtates in <hi>Ireland.</hi> Nay not even the faithful honeſt Inhabitants of thoſe very Towns (I mean <hi>Limerick, Waeerford, Galway)</hi> or ſuch Inhabitants of them (I ſay) as were not guilty of the Crimes committed by their fellow-Gitizens; Unleſs (peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) this Perſon of Quality can evince, that the Laws in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve the Innocent with the Nocent; and that a good King doing Juſtice to his People (not by the Sword drawn, or Cannon charged, or Legions marſhall'd, aſſaulting a Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Town, or Men in Armes, but by the Laws, and Judges, and other Civil Miniſters of Juſtice) ought not to diſcriminate 'twixt the juſt and the wicked: Or unleſs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Will he not leave in his Majeſties power to be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful?

            <p n="60">60. I profeſs I am ignorant of what this Gentleman <note place="margin">Pag. 31.</note> means by the Sin of Apoſtacy in the <hi>Iriſh;</hi> if he means the Catholicks generally, with relation to the Peace of 48. and I believe it was only mentioned to bring in <hi>Lots Wife,</hi> and the <hi>Pillar of Salt,</hi> into which, his whole diſcourſe makes it very probable, he could wiſh every <hi>Iriſh</hi> Catholick turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that would look back either upon City or Country.

            <p n="63">63. Alwayes when there is ſpeech of Catholick Tenets, this Gentleman ſtumbles unhappily. For where he ſayes, <hi>The Doctrine of Regicide is common in the</hi> Roman <hi>Schools,</hi> he miſtook them for the Schools of <hi>Geneva,</hi> and of thoſe of <note place="margin">Pag. 32.</note> their Principles. Had he but enquired, he might have learn'd, that the Doctrine of Reg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="64">64.

               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:38030:31"/> to magnifie their Juriſdiction, and give Laws to their Party to avoid confuſion.

Among the many particular Obſervations with which I have, and ſhall be hereafter forced to charge the memory of the Reader, I beg of him, that he be ſo juſt, as not to allow this Gentleman to calumniate the Nation for the Crimes of particular men: And, when he repeats, even to tediouſneſs, the ſame thing, not to expect from me a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iteration of the ſame anſwer. Here he ſayes again, and as untruly as before, that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſts did diſtruſt, diſobey, <hi>oppoſe, and excommunicate the Lord Lieutenant;</hi> and this <note place="margin">Pag. 33.</note> upon no other ground, than that the Clergy of <hi>James-town</hi> did ſo; when I have proved before out of his own Doctrine <note place="margin">Obſerve Reader, that the Perſon of Quality never once mentions the Biſhops convened at <hi>James-town,</hi> nor <hi>James-town</hi> it ſelf; not out of any deſire to conceal or paſs over that un-Biſhop-like Errour of theirs, But of purpoſe to delude thee, and make it ſeem a general Act of the whole Nation, which was only the Tranſgreſſion of a few Prelates.</note> of <hi>free Repreſentatives,</hi> that the Nation oppoſed their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.

               <hi>him to the worſt ſort of Murtherers,</hi> that is to <hi>Cromwell,</hi> whom perhaps this Gentleman ſerved at that time, when he himſelf <hi>Fol.</hi> 30. aſcribes this deſign only to the Citizens of <hi>Waterford.</hi> If Arguments of this nature be admitted, I can prove by the ſame Logick, that his Majeſties Army, under the Command of the Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> was defeated<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at the Battel of <hi>Roſſe,</hi> in the year 43. for it is certain, that ſome did ſhrink, and would have been guided in their retreat at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny rate; Therefore the Army ran away.</p>

               <hi>Catholicks fought againſt the Regicides, in defence of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Rights,</hi> ſhould break out into ſo immoderate paſſion againſt me. And asking of ſome Friends, whence they conceived this ſhould proceed, I was told by one of them, better verſed in the propriety of <hi>Engliſh</hi> words than I am, that the words, <hi>to deſert,</hi> in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> are alwayes taken in a bad ſenſe, and among Souldiers, ſignifie commonly, not only a deſiſting from action, but a joyning with the Enemy; which, I proteſt, was not, nor in truth could be my mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I ſay in relation to thoſe Proteſtant Royaliſts, that, having paſt unblemiſh'd through all tryals, and being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pow'red, and ſeeing no way (under Heaven) left them to maintain the moſt juſt Cauſe, which they endeavoured through all extremities to aſſert, <hi>deſeruerunt cauſam,</hi> gave it over, and laid down Armes.

And it may be that he himſelf is a witneſs beyond all exception in the caſe, ſince perhaps he might have aſſiſted to take in <hi>Limerick</hi> and <hi>Galway;</hi> after which ſieges there was no further exerciſes of that kind given to <hi>Cromwell,</hi> and his Aſſociates, any where, in favour of his Majeſties intereſts.

I cannot blame this Gentleman, that he ſeeks good company for thoſe whom he meant to patronize, and would <note place="margin">Pag. 36, 34, 35.</note> rank them with thoſe under the Lord Lieutenants immediate Command in <hi>Dublin,</hi> who near upon four years after, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſeen two Armies of the Confederates, under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Nuncio, near the City, fearing a ſecond at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, having had their quarters entirely deſtroyed, obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Majeſties command, in giving up <hi>Dublin,</hi> and the reſt of the Garriſons to the Parliament. To make the parity reach home, the party in <hi>Munſter</hi> ſhould have attended the commands of a lawful power; and although they have obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed neceſſity, and laid down their Armes; yet it had been their duty, as Subjects, and Souldiers, to have behaved themſelves as did the generous Officers at <hi>Dublin,</hi> who neither ſued for, nor accepted employment under the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. And I may well ſay, that this their defection was fatal to his Majeſties intereſt in <hi>Ireland;</hi> for had they kept them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a condition to joyn with the reſt of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtants in the Peace which was concluded in the year 46. the confuſion, which was introduced by the breach of it, had been prevented, and <hi>Owen ô Neill</hi> had wanted ſtrength to countenance that rupture.</p>
            <p n="71">71. In the Year 48. the Lord of <hi>Inchiquin</hi> having been advertized out of <hi>France</hi> of the reſolution taken again to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the Lord Lieutenant in the ſervice of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the ſupreme Council of the Confederates having received the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:38030:33"/> ſame advertizement, both readily condeſcended to a Ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Armes in order to the Peace which was to follow. And the Lord of <hi>Inchiquin,</hi> who, with wonderful dexteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, managed that affair, maugre the oppoſition of ſome of the Officers, prevail'd with the Army under his Command to declare for the King. And it cannot be denied that they proved very uſeful in the Cauſe, as well in the proſecution, <note place="margin">Pag. 34.</note> as after in aſſiſting to take in <hi>Drogheda, Dundalk,</hi> and other Garriſons kept by the Enemy, after the concluſion of the Peace. But the defeat at <hi>Rathmynes,</hi> and the landing of <hi>Cromwell,</hi> made them think of bettering their fortunes, by ſiding with the more ſucceſsful Party.

               <hi>preſervation of their lives, were forced to keep as ſtrict Guards againſt the</hi> Iriſh <hi>Papists, as againſt</hi> Cromwell.

            <p n="72">72.

            <p n="73">73. Although this Gentleman ſhould be ſo indulgent to thoſe <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtants, as to endeavour to perſwade us they were but <hi>Rebells ſeemingly;</hi> Yet I am ſure he cannot <note place="margin">Pag. 38.</note> have the confidence to ſay, but that they, who imbrued their hands in the blood of thoſe that avowedly, and under his Majeſties authority fought for his Intereſts, who beſieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Cities and Forts, and took his Ships at Sea, over-act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their parts.</p>
            <p n="74">74.

Had not the Reader already been acquainted with the nature of thoſe inferences which this Gentleman fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently makes, ſometimes upon illuſorie, ſometimes upon falſe grounds, This, which he calls an <hi>Experiment,</hi> might have paſt for a Judgement in the Caſe: Since the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks

But to unriddle the myſtery of this <hi>Experiment,</hi> it will be neceſſary we ſhould know the truth of the ſtory, and thus you have it. After the revolted Party in <hi>Munſter</hi> had ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>Cromwell</hi> Maſter of that Province; and that (to uſe the Duke of <hi>Ormonds</hi> own words) <hi>for want of due comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from</hi> Limerick <hi>and</hi> Galway, <hi>but principally from</hi> Lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, <hi>it hath been impoſſible for us to raiſe or employ an Army againſt the Rebells; for to attempt this any where on the other ſide of the</hi> Shanon, <hi>but near</hi> Limerick, <hi>and without the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute command of that City to ſecure it, could be no other than the very certain ruine of the deſign in the very beginning of it, the Rebells pow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Secondly, All the regular wayes of maintaining the Army muſt have been clear laid aſide, the Charges being far greater than the Taxes and Contributions would ſatisfie: and the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> beſides their being unacquainted with that Province, had no inclination to that courſe the Souldier was neceſſitated to take for his ſubſiſtence, nor his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency to put them upon it.

Fourthly, His Excellency might have conſidered, that their Parents and Kindred, and thoſe that would aſſiſt to maintain them, upon laying down Armes, were, either in <hi>England,</hi> or in thoſe parts of <hi>Ireland,</hi> poſſeſt by the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.

               <note place="margin">Pag. 44, 45.</note> 
               <hi>for the freedom of the Catholick Religion:</hi> And then he flies out to thoſe Excurſions, with which he garniſhes each Diſh of the great Feaſt he has with ſo much pain and induſtry pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for his Party. <hi>Certainly</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>if ever they may be believed to speak truth, it is when they speak to the Pope.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pag. 45.</note> And this truth, which is ſought to be extorted from them by ſo witty an argument, is a truth I never heard denied by any of them, <hi>viz. That they,</hi> in part, <hi>raiſed Armes for the freedom of the Catholick Religion:</hi> (though partly too, nay primarily, at firſt, and in relation to the generality of <hi>Iriſh</hi> Catholicks, who were forc'd out, for the ſafety of their lives and natural being) Nay, it is probable, that they inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Commiſſioners to preſs this Article, wherein his Holineſs was moſt intereſted, to the Pope, as an eſpecial motive to procure them aſſiſtance. But was this the whole truth? Did they raiſe Armes for no other end, than for the freedom of the Catholick Religion? Nay did they raiſe Armes for no other end than this, and the ſafety of their lives too? Will not this Gentleman, that believes them ſo obliged to tell the Pope the Truth, have ſo much charity for them, as to think they likewiſe ſpake truth in the ſight of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:38030:38"/> Heaven, when <hi>they proteſt and ſwear before God, his Saints, and his Angels, that they will bear, during their lives, true Faith and Allegiance to their Soveraign Lord</hi> Charles, <hi>by the Grace of God King of</hi> Great Britain, France, <hi>and</hi> Ireland, <hi>his Heirs, and lawful Succeſſors; and that they will, to their power, during their lives, defend, uphold and maintain all his and their juſt Prerogatives, Eſtates and Rights,</hi> &amp;c? Could this Gentleman, that ſet down in his Book the very Oath, be ignorant of what himſelf writes? Or can his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice be ſo great, as to think, that thoſe who meant to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form that part of the Oath which concerned Religion, were reſolved to be willful Perjurers in that which concerns the King?</p>
            <p n="90">90.

But they were farr from being all ſo.

For taking both the Texts together, which this Gentleman, to make the Comment the fuller, hath divided; and reflecting upon the evill times, and the neceſſity to which the Catholicks were reduced, and how nothing was to be acted, but by the advice of thoſe that were employed into <hi>France</hi> to his Majeſty, and the Queen his Mother, it was no wonder, ſuppoſing the Pope would be munificent towards the maintenance of that War, which, beſides the intereſts of Catholick Religion, had for ſcope the re-inthroning of the King, that his Holineſs ſhould be admitted to receive reaſonable ſatisfaction by the Articles: and to oblige the Pope to deſcend to ſuch Conditions, as
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:38030:38"/> might be granted in matters of Religion, that they were to repreſent to his Holineſs the lowneſs of their own conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the power and ſtrength of their Enemies; and to ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit for conſiderable aides whereby to maintain a War; <hi>And not only that, but to aſcertain and ſecure the ſame.</hi>

               <note place="margin">Pag. 47.</note> 
               <hi>Pope is their King?</hi> Does it appear by this, <hi>That the</hi> Iriſh <hi>Papiſts hang, as their Faith in God, ſo their Loyalty to the Prince, on the Popes ſleeve?</hi> Yet after his accuſtomed man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <note place="margin">Pag. 47.</note> he comments thus upon that Text, and would liken the protection they ſought to the power of the Protector <note place="margin">Pag. 47.</note> in <hi>England,</hi> which beyond Royal was Tyrannical; although ſome men by elaborated ſpeeches ſtrove to make it Legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, by conferring Kingſhip on <hi>Cromwell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="93">93. We are now come to the Year 1648. and here again we find this Gentleman forgets not to allege, with the ſame truth he had before, that <hi>the</hi> Iriſh <hi>Papiſts diſowned</hi> the Peace <note place="margin">Pag. 47.</note> then made, <hi>diſobeyed, oppoſed, conspired to murther, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated, and baniſhed his Majeſties Vice-Roy.</hi> But ſhould I repeat my Anſwers, as often as he reiterates his Charge, my Reply would grow to a Volume. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I referr the Reader to what is formerly ſaid: as I do to what belongs to his ſummary Concluſion.</p>
            <p n="94">94. It is true, that in ſome points of Faith, the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks oppoſe both the Proteſtants and Sectaries; but the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick <note place="margin">Pag. 48.</note> and Proteſtant Royaliſt agree in point of Loyalty. <note place="margin">The fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides, or Sectaries.</note> And to prove this by an Experiment, more convincing than that which this Gentleman formerly gave us, theſe two Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties joyned for two or three years under the ſame Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, in the ſame Army, to fight againſt thoſe this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman's Proteſtants, which can be no other than Sectaries. <hi>And if not the fighting, but the ground and end of the fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pag. 48.</note> 
               <hi>proves which is the good Subject:</hi> This reaches home to thoſe, that to palliate their evill intentions, feigned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Proteſtant Royaliſts. And when <hi>Cromwell</hi> went into <hi>Ireland,</hi> deſerting his Majeſties ſervice, preſented him with
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:38030:39"/> the fruits of their treachery, the City of <hi>Cork,</hi> and the reſt of thoſe ſtrong holds in <hi>Munſter,</hi> whilſt the true Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Royaliſt, and the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Catholick, ſtuck to their Principles: And not content to abſtain from the Rebells in <hi>Ireland,</hi> many of them adhered to his Majeſty in his baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and followed his fortune abroad. Now how could <hi>Sampſon</hi> himſelf <hi>tye their tails together,</hi> that ſcarce ever met, but as Enemies, is a riddle to me. <note place="margin">Pag. 49.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="95">95. The reaſon why I ſaid that the power of this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman's Proteſtants in <hi>Ireland, was no greater than his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty was pleaſed to make it,</hi> was grounded on the reports which were daily brought to <hi>London</hi> of the Phanaticks mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <note place="margin">Pag. 49.</note> not to give way to the execution of any of the Kings Orders, by which any of the Natives was to be reſtored: And knowing that there wanted no hands among the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Royaliſts, and the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Catholicks, ſufficient to bring them to reaſon, I ſlighted their threats, and their power, to ſecond them, by ſaying, that <hi>it is no greater</hi> (as in truth it is not) <hi>than his Majesty is pleaſed to make it.</hi> As for the <hi>Elogium</hi> that follows, if the Gentleman holds himſelf to my intention, he muſt allow that it wholly concerns the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticks.</p>

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:38030:39"/> Articles of Peace were not ſo common, as to be in the hands of very many.</p>
            <p>This Gentleman will give me leave to ask him whether he himſelf believes the King broke his Coronation Oath, or <note place="margin">Pag. 51.</note> gave away his Militia, becauſe he granted that this ſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable an Army ſhould be kept on foot under the conduct of his Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi> for maintenance of his intereſts, in ſo great ſtreights as his Majeſty was reduced to, at a time when his enemies had thrice that number in the Field againſt him? Did the King break his Oath, or give away his right in the Treaſury, becauſe he gave power to his Lieutenant, with the advice of certain ſelect Perſons of the Natives to levy money for the maintenance of this Army, and for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther charges incident to the Government? Or do thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect perſons aſſume the legiſlative power of the Kingdom, becauſe it is inſerted in thoſe Articles, that both Houſes of Parliament may conſider what they ſhall think convenient touching the repeal or ſuſpenſion of the Statute commonly called <hi>Poynings Act?</hi> And cannot his Majeſty pardon his Subjects of <hi>Ireland,</hi> although he give his Royal Aſſent to an Act paſt in the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> by which ſuch par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don before conviction is declared null and void?</p>
            <p n="98">98. He adds, <hi>That although the</hi> Iriſh <hi>Catholicks chiefly</hi>

               <hi>pleaded for reſtitution of their Eſtates by vertue of thoſe Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; yet if they had prevailed therein upon the ſcore of that plea, it muſt in conſequence have adjudged for them the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of all the other Articles as a Right.</hi> But this Gentleman foreſees not, that he is to convince himſelf of an untruth, <hi>fol.</hi> 79. where he ſays, and that truly, <hi>That the moſt eſſen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tial parts of the Articles of Peace were to be finally obliging,</hi>

               <hi>but as they were to be confirmed by Act of Parliament, in the next Parliament which ſhould be aſſembled after the perfecting of the ſaid Articles of Peace.</hi> So as his Majeſties promiſes are partly abſolute, partly relative to his further pleaſure: But no Wood comes amiſs to this Gentleman, of which Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows may be made to ſhoot at the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Catholicks.

            <p n="99">
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:38030:40"/> 99. This Gentleman might have taken notice, that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Catholicks have in all the Papers publiſhed by them, <note place="margin">Pag. 52.</note> and in all their pleadings before his Majeſty, been ſo careful of the intention his Royal Father of happy memory expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſee the juſt Adventurer ſatisfied, that they made no oppoſition thereunto.

               <hi>Ireland</hi> as a legal engagement.

               <hi>violation of it by undeniable evidences,</hi> when the Reader is yet to ſeek even for any plauſible argument to induce him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the breach of it.

            <p n="103">103. I cannot imagine, wherefore a man, that ſhews himſelf ſo witty in expreſſing his malice, ſhould repeat in every Leaf, the Heads of his odious Accuſation againſt the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Catholicks: unleſs that like a Fidler, who had in charge to ſing the Ballad, he meant at every cloſe to put his party in mind of the Burden of the Song.</p>
            <p n="104">104. Now indeed we have ſomewhat new, but of the ſame ſtamp. For this Gentleman alleges, <hi>That the</hi> Iriſh <hi>Papiſts being not able to keep the Condition expreſſed in their</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pag. 56.</note> 
               <hi>Recognition which preceded the Articles, inviolable, they broke them.</hi> And becauſe the Reader may have all before him, I do here inſert that Act of Recognition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>His Majeſties</hi> Roman <hi>Catholick Subjects (as thereunto bound by Allegiance, Duty, and Nature) do moſt humbly and</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Articles of Peace, <hi>Pag.</hi> 1, <hi>or</hi> 6.</note> 
               <hi>freely acknowledge, and recognize their Soveraign Lord King</hi> Charles <hi>to be lawful and undoubted King of this Kingdom of</hi> Ireland, <hi>and other his Highneſs Realms and Dominions. And his Majeſties ſaid</hi> Roman <hi>Catholick Subjects apprehending with a deep ſenſe the ſad condition whereunto his Majeſty is reduced, as a further humble teſtimony of their Loyalty, do declare, that they, and their poſterity, for ever, to the uttermoſt of their power, even to the expence of their blood and fortunes, will maintain and uphold his Majeſty, his Heirs, and lawful Succeſſors, their Rights, Prerogatives, Government, and</hi>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:38030:41"/> 
               <hi>Authority, and thereunto freely and heartily will render all due Obedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="105">105. No man denies that this Recognition was made by their ruling power. And it might be accounted a natural and genuine Inference, that thoſe that brake it denied themſelves the benefit of the Articles of Peace. <hi>But that the ruling Power of the</hi> Iriſh <hi>Catholicks publiſhed the breach thereof to the World, or that their ruling Power made that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pag. 56.</note> 
               <hi>of the</hi> 12th. <hi>of</hi> Auguſt 1650. <hi>is an evident un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth,</hi> as is formerly proved.</p>
            <p n="106">106. As for this Gentleman's Dilemma here in the 56. Page of his Book, to prove, <hi>That even thoſe who made theſe Articles with the Lord Lieutenant, were guilty of their breach,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pag. 56.</note> it is anſwered, That ſuch of that Aſſembly as broke them, or did not effectually obſerve, as much as lay in them, the Conditions of the Recognition, did really tranſgreſs the duty expreſſed therein; yet not when they made thoſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, but when they broke them ſo. For it is evident, that every one had ſufficient power and liberty to obſerve them in his own particular, if he pleaſed. But to ſay there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that ſuch of that Aſſembly as preſerved themſelves from diſobedience, were anſwerable for other men (ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſince it is acknowledged that they reſigned the power to others, even by thoſe Articles) or were abuſers of his Majeſties Authority and ſervice, muſt be a very wild infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference. Wherefore our Gentleman's conditional <hi>not able,</hi> and <hi>were able,</hi> and his Concluſion intended thence, is a meer Fallacy, confounding Times and Abilities, and Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall, with Particulars, and Effects with their Cauſes, and the obligations of uſing their beſt endeavours with that of the future being of things, and of a ſucceſs which God alone could aſcertain.</p>
            <p n="107">107. Now we are come to the Oaths of <hi>Aſſociation,</hi> and to another Oath, by which this Gentleman would prove, <note place="margin">Pag. 57.</note> that the Peace was <hi>deſignedly broken before it was made.</hi> As nothing did ever yet conduce more to the vindication of <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, of ever bleſſed memory, from the horrid Calumnies with which his Enemies did aſperſe him, than
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:38030:41"/> the printing of his Letters taken at the Battel of <hi>Nasby:</hi> So with due reverence to his Sacred name, I may ſay, that nothing could have befallen of more advantage to the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Catholicks, than that all their Books, and all the original Papers of their home and forein Tranſactions, have come into the hands of their Adverſaries; and that the whole ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of them ſhould be thus ſpread abroad, and be thus il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrated with ſuch a Comment, as leaves nothing unſaid that Art or Mal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ce could ſuggeſt. For if they had not been maſters of thoſe Books, and Papers, they who now accuſe the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks to have ſought for aſſiſtance, in their greateſt neceſſities, from a forein protection; would then proclame to the World, that they were become the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of another Prince, and had ſworn Fealty to him. They that now, by all the Cavills and Fallacies imaginable, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to find out Contradictions in their Oaths, and do comment only upon their Intentions; would then publiſh, that they had expreſly ſworn to exclude his Majeſty, and to chooſe a King of the Nation. They who now by weak in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences would prove, that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſts mea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Proteſtant Religion; would then averr, that they had ſworn to extirpate all Proteſtants, the Proteſtant Prelates eſpecially. They who now only upbraid them for having proceeded againſt the Laws of the Kingdom; would then loudly declare, that they had clean, laid them aſide; and that they had introduced, and were ſworn to maintain the <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hon</hi> Law. Their Crimes would have been as many, and as hainous as their Adverſaries could fancy them; and their actions would have been conveighed to Poſterity in a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of horrour and perfidy. But now they give us the Text out of their own Record, and nothing is left them but to comment upon it; which this Gentleman omits not to doe, with ſuch a ſophiſtry, and ſo great a willingneſs, to make them ſeem black and hideous, as the Catholicks may eſteem it happy for them, that he is not wholly left at large to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his invention.</p>
            <p n="108">108. But although this Perſon of Quality may have thoſe Records in his cuſtody, yet I will give him my aſſiſtance to ſort them, by letting him know the Time and Occaſion upon
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:38030:42"/> which theſe ſeveral Oaths were taken. And with his good leave I muſt tell him, that this which he ſets forth to be in <hi>the firſt roul,</hi> is a complicated Oath, to which the later part, which begins <hi>Moreover,</hi> was not added untill the Year <note place="margin">Pag. 58. Pag. 59.</note> 1646. In which year likewiſe, the <hi>Oath of adhering to the preſent Union of the Confederate Catholicks that rejected the Peace</hi> was adminiſtred. And it might very well have happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Grand Committee, upon failer of the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Articles of Peace then to be concluded, obliged themſelves to reaſſume their Union. But this muſt have been in the Year 1645. before the Peace of 46. was aſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto by a Party, that in favour of the <hi>Nuncio,</hi> who op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed it, moved all ſcruples imaginable; and might have objected, that if ſuch another as Sir <hi>William Parſons,</hi> who would not perform thoſe Articles, came to govern the Kingdom, what was to be done in that Caſe? This remedy might perhaps have been thought proper for their ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But that this ſhould have happened in the Year 48. is an aſſertion as vain, as it is malicious. For the World knows that the Peace of 48. was treated and concluded una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly by the Aſſembly, the Lord Lieutenant being in the ſame City with them. And as to the Committee, the name and uſe of it was very ſuperfluous in a place where a few Perſons daily brought the ſenſe of the Houſe in difficult matters to his Excellency, and what ſeemed to be knotty of the part of his Excellency, was upon all occaſions reſolved by the Aſſembly, that conſtantly ſate at ſo near a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
            <p n="109">109. I ſhall likewiſe give the Reader this faithful relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as to the other Oaths. When the Peace of 46. was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by the greater Vote of thoſe, who, by the terrour of the <hi>Northern Army,</hi> by the ſuggeſtion of the <hi>Nuncio</hi>'s <note place="margin">Pag. 64, 65.</note> active Emiſſaries, and by the affright of an <hi>Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> were induced to violate the publick Faith; Which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly is the ground of all the ſufferings of the Nation: Then it was that the ſame Aſſembly framed that Oath of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to the Union of the Confederate <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks that rejected the Peace. And having choſen a ſupreme Council, compoſed for the moſt part of the rejecters of the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:38030:42"/> Peace, they for that time conceived themſelves ſecure. But the People having had ſome reſpite from the fears they had before entertained, coming to a new Election for the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Aſſembly, ſuch, for the moſt part, were choſen to be of the ſupreme Council, that had ſerved in that place before, and were known to have good inclinations to ſettle the Kingdom under his Majeſties Government. Wherefore the Prelates diſtruſting thoſe hands, into which the power of the Confederates was committed, got that part which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins with the word <hi>Moreover,</hi> to be added to the Oath of <note place="margin">Pag. 59.</note> Aſſociation; and the general Aſſembly, that knew it was, and alwayes kept it in their power to approve of, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to any Peace they thought fit, gave them ſatisfaction in that which could no longer interrupt a ſettlement, than they liſt.</p>
            <p n="110">110. Having thus placed the Gentlemans Records in due order, and given the Reader ſome light to lead him through <note place="margin">Pag. 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68.</note> a diſcourſe knotty and perplext, and endeavoured to be made ſo, if I be not much deceived, I ſhall deſcend to the Commentary. But I ſhall firſt deſire the Reader to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that I take not upon me, with relation to theſe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py times, when the Reſtoration of his Majeſty hath given life to his Laws, to juſtifie the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Catholicks againſt Mr. Attorney at the Bar. His Majeſties Mercy is their ſole plea, and the Sanctuary to which they reſort.</p>
            <p n="111">111. Wherefore laying aſide thoſe legal Tryals (by which infallibly, thoſe who ſet up a Government, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to his Majeſties, by what hand ſoever that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was managed, thoſe that ſwear to obey and ratifie all the Orders and Decrees made, and to be made by ſuch a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, would be adjudged Traytors) let us reſort back to thoſe confuſed times, and examine whether, as things then were carried, it might ſtand with the rules of Reaſon, and Self-preſervation, to admit, that (to ſwear) to bear true Faith and Allegiance to the King, and to ſwear to obey and ratifie all the Orders and Decrees made, and to be made by the Supreme Council, <hi>are flat and known contradictories?</hi> To prevent confuſion, they ſwear to obey the Orders of that Government they had ſet up themſelves; and if we
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:38030:43"/> ſhall allow to the nature of the times thoſe things which men ſeduced think neceſſary for their preſervation, why ſhould it be a flat contradictory to ſay, that at the ſame time <hi>they bare true Faith and Allegiance to the King,</hi> not by deſiſting <note place="margin">Pag. 60.</note> from doing thoſe things, without which they could not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, but by performing thoſe eminent duties to which their Faith and Allegiance at all Times, upon all Occaſions, and in all Conditions ſubject them? That is, not to pay the Fealty we owe him to any other Prince; not to aſſiſt or counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance the doing of the leaſt injury to his Perſon; to forbear taking any Oath that tends to exclude him, and his Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, from his Dominions; to fight againſt thoſe that do; and ſince we are unhappily fallen from our Obedience, to return to our former ſtate, as ſoon as poſſibly we can; and things of this nature.</p>
            <p n="112">112. Certainly if this Gentleman be not extremely inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, he is very forgetful, that holds ſo cloſe to the Law. And I aſſure him, <hi>That to maintain the fundamental Laws of</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pag. 60.</note> 
               <hi>the Kingdom, and the free exerciſe of the Catholick Religion,</hi> were, in thoſe times, thought to be things very compatible, however he takes them to be Contradictories.</p>
            <p n="113">113. He aggravates the matter (and ſo he might, if we did forget the nature of the Times) with their ſwearing not to ſeek or receive <hi>any pardon or protection for any thing done, or to be done, touching the general Cauſe.</hi> But allowing not <note place="margin">Pag. 61.</note> the Legality, but the Exiſtence of their Government, what could have preſerved it without ſuch tyes?</p>
            <p n="114">114. This Gentleman is alwayes at a fault when his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe tends any way to Catholick Religion. Our Tenet is quite contrary; for we know, that <hi>we cannot receive, nor the Pope give a pardon for ſins to come.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pag. 61.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="115">115. Now we are come to that part which was added to the Oath in the Year 46. and he tells us, they ſwear <hi>not to ſubmit to any Peace, made, or to be made, without the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of the general Aſſembly of the Catholicks.</hi> Of a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For it is no wonder, that they ſhould expect to have their own conſent and approbation to attend any Peace, that would be concluded, they themſelves being the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:38030:43"/> moſt numerous Repreſentative of the Nation. Had they confined it to the ſupreme Council, that in truth might be thought a limitation.</p>
            <p n="116">116. But this Gentleman, to aggravate their guilt, makes uſe, in my opinion, of a very ſpeculative Argument, ſaying, <hi>That if the King did not ſo much as name them, but</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pag. 61.</note> 
               <hi>make a Peace with them, as if they had never done any offence, they were debarred of it by this Oath.</hi> And I deſire to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, how it might otherwiſe be known, than by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and approbation of an Aſſembly, that they accepted of ſuch a Peace?</p>
            <p n="117">117. I have already mentioned how the Aſſembly gave way to the Propoſitions made by the Clergy, and had them confirmed by Oath, being loath to diſpleaſe ſo powerful a Party, in a matter which was no longer binding than an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly thought fit. And therefore this Gentleman may, without Reply from me, comment upon thoſe Propoſitions as he thinks fit. But, with his leave, he will not gather by any thing therein, <hi>That none ſhould be admitted to live in</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pag. 61.</note> Ireland <hi>but Papiſts.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> King maintains the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Clergy and Laity in the publick and free exerciſe of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Religion and Function throughout <hi>France,</hi> in as full luſtre and ſplendour as it was in the Reign of St. <hi>Lewis,</hi> yet he excludes not the <hi>Hugonotts.</hi>

Had this Gentleman dealt fairly with the Reader, he had not entertained him with <hi>Propoſitions</hi> which intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">Pag. 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79.</note> men do commonly make for their own advantage, and his Comments upon them: nor with <hi>Inſtructions</hi> which up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every occaſion are ſubject to alteration, and were given thoſe that agitated the affairs in 46. which I hope he will not deny.

               </hi> on the Deſcendants of <hi>Abraham,</hi> for the Rebellion of the Inhabitants, and this gift again confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him to them many hundred years after, even in that other great Parliament of Angels and Men, both which he held on <hi>Sina</hi> Mount, amidſt lightnings and thunders, and thoſe terrible voices, and the ſound of Clarions mingled in that loud dinn; confirmed, I ſay, with ſo much ſolemnity, and even confirmed in his written Laws, given there by <hi>Moſes</hi> to the Children of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and yet confirmed in a ſpecial command, given them, never to make Peace or Truce with the old Inhabitants of <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> not even with
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:38030:53"/> the <hi>Amorhites</hi> by name.

He might, after this, have conſidered, a Treaty of Peace entertained, nevertheleſs, with ſome of thoſe very Nations, with the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> I ſay, who were the Children of <hi>Amorheus,</hi> and a Peace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded with them by <hi>Joſuah,</hi> even God's own Lieutenant over his peculiar choſen people, and by his 12 great Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and without the knowledge or conſent of any other Aſſembly, Council, or Parliament of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> or of his great Army, or of the infinite number of other perſons, young men, old men, and women, and children of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Jacobs</hi> poſterity, who yet were all highly concerned in the effects of it, as being in part deſtructive to their rights, and leſſening the gift which God made to them, and quitting their claim to ſo many great Cities, and the territories ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning. He might further have remembred the deluſion and circumvention were ſuch, whereby thoſe <hi>Gibeonites</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Peace, that they were not known, or thought by <hi>Joſua,</hi> or by his Captains, to be Inhabitants of that Land, which God had beſtowed on the Children of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> the tatter'd rags, and old Shooes and wine bottles rent, and the dry and mouldy bread of theſe crafty Inhabitants, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thoſe manifeſt expreſs verbal lyes, which the <hi>Book of Joſuah</hi> relates, having been made uſe of by the fearful <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beonites</hi> to circumvent <hi>Joſuah,</hi> till he concluded with them. He might likewiſe have remembered the advancing of the Camp within three dayes after this Treaty perfected, to the very Cities of the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> to ſtorm them, as being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Lot of that Army of God, and ſuch as they had been long before commanded by God himſelf, and in his Law, to Conquer, even by deſtroying utterly the Inhabitants, root and branch: And might remember the Countermand given by <hi>Joſuah</hi> nevertheleſs, when he underſtood they belonged

And that their ſlavery was no other than to provide Water and Wood for the Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and publick Houſe of the God of Heaven. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any man will think they had a great deal of reaſon never to break thoſe conditions granted. And albeit I think there was as little reaſon for any <hi>Iriſh</hi> Catholick to break the conditions given them, eſpecially in that Peace of 48. and that I know nevertheleſs ſome, if not many, have; yet I do (and will conſtantly, till I be convinced with other arguments, than this anſwerer gives, which I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve I ſhall never be) always deny the univerſality, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, or indefiniteneſs of this propoſition, <hi>The</hi> Iriſh <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts broke, yea often, if not always, theirs,</hi> in that ſenſe at leaſt he muſt have had, or intended to import, if he would ſpeak to any purpoſe; that is, in relation to the Peace of 48. in which meaning, as I have before ſufficiently declared, by relating this Gentleman's proofs, and otherwiſe, the falſity of this aſſertion: ſo I now again briefly averr, that neither the univerſality, or generality, nor greater part, nor ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling power; nor the formal or virtual repreſentatives of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſts, broke as much as once that Peace: ſo far were
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:38030:59"/> they from <hi>brcaking often, if not alwayes the conditions of it.</hi> And if none of all theſe did, though confeſſedly ſome of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> did, or the leſſer, or even a great, or conſiderable part of them (if he will have it ſo) did, what is that to the Univerſality, or Generality at leaſt, which that indefinite charge of his imports? or what indeed, to any other <hi>Iriſh</hi> Catholick (to conclude them) but the very individuals that did ſo? He might as well, and as truly have ſaid, that the Proteſtants of <hi>England,</hi> or <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation were againſt the King, and for <hi>Cromwel,</hi> or the <hi>Rump</hi> Parliament; when both or either did moſt cruelly Tyranize: For not only ſome of thoſe Proteſtants, or of that Nation, but even ſo great and conſiderable a party were ſo; nay, which is more, both the repreſenting and ruling power, which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, or Nation of <hi>England</hi> were known at that time to own, or at leaſt, which in effect, and even with all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities repreſented and ruled them (whether by force and coaction, or not, it matters not here) without any contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction were ſo. Whence it is that I may advance a little further yet, and may tell this Gentleman, that can be no refuge for him, if he ſhould ſay, that he can maintain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure, ſome appearance of Truth in ſome part, at leaſt of this propoſition, that <hi>the</hi> Iriſh <hi>Papiſts broke, yea often, if not alwayes, theirs:</hi> or, (which is the thing I mean) that he can maintain that latitude, univerſality, generality, or inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finiteneſs, in relation at leaſt to ſome one breach, and ſome one Peace, <hi>viz.</hi> that of 46. For I can averr confidently, that all his arguments to prove this, will by a manifeſt ſequel of reaſon, prove, that the Proteſtants or Nation of <hi>England,</hi> broke all their ties of Duty, and Allegiance, and Faith to his late Majeſty, and his lawfull Succeſſor (whom God, of his mercy, cont<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And that neither this Famine, nor that Execution, have been, even in any part, for any of thoſe other oppreſſions the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> ſuffered from <hi>Saul!</hi> And further yet, that no kind of unjuſt oppreſſions of theſe <hi>peaceable Slaves,</hi> would have had provoked the wrath of God in any wiſe againſt <hi>Saul,</hi> or his Children, or the People, had he abſtained only from that of <hi>killing?</hi> And laſtly, that all that Vengeance upon their Tribes, aad the ſeven Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren of <hi>Saul,</hi> had no relation to the breach of Arricles, or of the League formerly made with the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> and ſhould have been either deſerved by, or inflicted for the cruelty of <hi>Saul</hi> to theſe poor people, had they never made by themſelves, or by their Predeceſſors before them, any kind of League with the <hi>Iſraelites?</hi> If our Perſon of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity ſhall anſwer, his meaning was not to abuſe the Reader ſo, or to perſwade him to any of thoſe Particulars, I demand of him then, what will his acute Animadverſion ſignifie, to prove any difference here, that is not very immaterial? Would it not be (think you Reader) an excellent Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cination if this Gentleman diſcourſed thus in plain terms. <hi>Saul</hi>'s Children were not executed, nor the twelve Tribes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> puniſhed with a grievous Famine of three years, becauſe the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> had been continued by <hi>Saul, hewers of wood, and drawers of Water,</hi> unto the Houſe of the Lord,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:38030:64"/> as they had been many hundreds of years before, and had been ſo without any injury or breach of their firſt Articles, or any farther ſlavery impoſed upon them; but <hi>Saul</hi>'s Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren were executed, and the twelve Tribes puniſhed ſo, becauſe that King did <hi>kill</hi> ſome of them, and did not ſimply kill them, but killed them againſt Articles, and againſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles ſworn unto by invocation of the God of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and did not only kill ſome of them againſt Articles ſo confirmed, but attempted to deſtroy all their Countrymen for ever, and conſequently brought on ſuch as did ſurvive all thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther miſeries and oppreſſions, which muſt have attended his cruel attempt, to deprive them, &amp; their Wives, and Children, and all their Nation, of their Cities, of their Corporations, of their Houſes, of their Lands, of all their Liberties Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and Civil, and by conſequence of their Lives too, or certainly to bring evills on them worſe than death. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Majeſty needs not fear the application of that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, or of that Judgement of God on the Houſe of <hi>Saul,</hi> or of any part of it, or the like, or of any proportionable to the publick and horrid ſin of the notorious breach of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, and even the breach of them, by deſtroying not four Cities, nor four Corporations alone, but a hundred, and twenty or thirty thouſand Proprietors, and a million of Relations depending of them; yea a whole and great Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by depriving them all for ever of all their Towns, Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages, Houſes, Lands, Liberties, both Religious and Civil, and (I ſay) by depriving them thus againſt the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs letter and ſenſe of Articles of Peace, and of ſuch Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles too, as they had, for their parts, punctually kept; provided only, that his Majeſty killed not the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> by ſhedding their blood, though he make them groan perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally under oppreſſions more unſupportable to free-born Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects than death it ſelf.</p>

But not to perplex the Reader any more with this imaginary caſe, or the Perſon of Quality with troubleſome apprehenſions, how to anſwer in it, without ſpeaking his own condemnation out of his own mouth, let us on both ſides put off our ſuppoſitious Perſons, and return again to our own, he to his, and I to mine, and both to the caſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, which has a real being. And let the Reader judge of my following Anſwers to his evill Application of that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Saul's Children,</hi> &amp;c. For I muſt tell him,</p>
            <p>Firſt, That the <hi>hanging up to the Lord of the Children of</hi> Saul <hi>in</hi> Gibeah <hi>of</hi> Saul, cannot be a Precedent to any mortal Man, King, or inferiour Judge, to warrant the like, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther puniſhment of Innocents, unleſs an Oracle of God, or a ſpecial Revelation or Inſpiration extraordinary from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, did ſpeak the pleaſure of God to that purpoſe; as in the permiſſion given by <hi>David</hi> to put thoſe Children of <hi>Saul</hi> to death.</p>

For if our Perſon of Quality will inſiſt upon any
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:38030:72"/> ſuch Obligation of Conſcience, or even Expediency, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing thence, and that his Majeſty were once perſwaded thereof, what ſhould then become of this Gentleman, and his beloved People, in relation to whom there muſt be in all Contingencies a farr greater tye of Conſcience or a farr greater Expediency ariſing from that very Example to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them? What, I ſay, of his or their Children, even ſuch as have <hi>not been actually guilty of their Fathers Rebellions?</hi> Rebellions ten thouſand times more hainons, more execrable, than that of the worſt principled of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> can be juſtly ſaid to have been.</p>
            <p n="160">160. And if our Perſon of Quality would, in caſe of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch reſolution in his Majeſty, enter into a Plea of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, grounded now indeed upon that of the Letters from <hi>Breda,</hi> or Acts of Indempnity confirmed by aſſent Royal, and would enter this Plea of Juſtice, not for the innocent Children alone, but their Fathers too, of his Party, who had not ſince that Oblivion treſpaſſed againſt the Laws: Why may not <hi>à fortiori,</hi> the Catholicks of <hi>Ireland,</hi> who broke not their Articles, be admitted likewiſe to a Plea of Juſtice, yea notwithſtanding their former Rebellions?

               </gap>ea too, and hope even for that Mercy to themſelves, and to their Children alſo, which this Perſon of Quality would ſue for to his own, in this laſt Caſe?</p>
            <p n="162">162. And if to theſe, or to their ſute for Mercy, in ſuch a caſe,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:38030:73"/> that example of <hi>Saul's Children hang'd in</hi> Gibeah <hi>of</hi> Saul, could be no obſtruction, no hinderance of his Majeſties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciencious, gracious, and mercifull pardon, or gift even to their Children after them, of their Fathers Inheritance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Wars, and not only of ſuch as were entayl'd; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can it be in the preſent caſe of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> or of ſuch of them as have broke, even the Peace of 48. any more, but rather much leſs groundedly alleged to debarr his Majeſties compaſſion of their Children, or themſelves either.</p>
            <p n="163">163. Secondly, Or to his alluſion to <hi>the Famine continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed until Juſtice was done, &amp;c.</hi> I muſt tell him alſo, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is very obvious; that for the wrong done the <hi>Gibeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pag. 92.</note> there was no puniſhment inflicted, no reparation made, no Juſtice done by the hand of Man, before <hi>the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Sons of</hi> Saul <hi>were hanged:</hi> And therefore we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it is very ſuitable to the Juſtice of God that Famine ſhould laſt, until, even ſome deſcending from his very loyns, that ſo cruelly oppreſſed the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> againſt publick Faith or Covenant, were puniſhed by the very hands of the ſelf ſame people. Whereby to teach the world how horrible muſt be the Sin of Article-breaking: Whereon peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the very choſen <hi>Iſraelites</hi> themſelves had not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe much reflected. But for the wrongs done by the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Catholicks at any time, ſince the firſt inſurrection on the 23 of <hi>October</hi> 41. not ſeven perſons alone, but ſeven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, nay ſevenſcore (if not ſeventy times ſeven ſcore) thouſand have been long ſince puniſhed by the Juſtice, and by the hands of men, and puniſhed even moſt exemplarly, and not the nocent only, but the innocent, without any diſtinction or compaſſion, even armleſs and harmleſs day-la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers, and women, and children, even babes, and Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome-ſucklings, hanging at their Mothers breaſts; yea very many puniſhed in a legal way, tryed in open Courts, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, executed, hang'd, ſhot, beheaded, and quartered. So that to pretend in this caſe of <hi>Ireland</hi> any defect of exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary puniſhment, or ſufficient publick Juſtice, even by the hand of Man, and from ſuch defect a <hi>Famine,</hi> or other viſible Judgement upon the Kingdom now, or ſince the Reſtoration of his Majeſty, were to allege a cauſe that is
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:38030:73"/> not, and an effect which we perceive not; being we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but ſee and acknowledge ever ſince that happy return of his Majeſtie, a return likewiſe of all plenty, and other both earthly, and heavenly bleſſings throughout his Majeſties Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions. Which had this Perſon of Quality better conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it is like he would not have mentioned here, in this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion, <hi>the laſting of the Famine till Juſtice was done,</hi> and <hi>the ceaſlng</hi> of it, after that was done. For if his alluſion hold, the ceſſation of all thoſe foregoing publique Judgements, and the ſucceſſion of the greateſt mercies throughout the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Empire, muſt be rather an argument that ſo much Juſtice is done already, as the juſt anger of God required, than that any more ſhould be.</p>
            <p n="164">164. Thirdly, Or to ſhew the ineptitude likewiſe (to his end) of his Antitheſis; <hi>Thoſe loſt their lives for their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Sin; but theſe (if any) loſe but their Fathers forfeited</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pag. 92.</note> 
               <hi>Eſtates. P. W.</hi> entreats the Reader to weigh this following Ratiocination, which our Perſon of Quality will find himſelf obliged to build upon it.</p>
            <p n="165">165. By Miracle, and by Oracle, or by a ſpecial Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation or Inſpiration from Heaven, and by wonderful Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on the twelve Tribes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> univerſally, for three whole years, <hi>David</hi> the Prophet, and Familiar of God, was inſtructed, that it was the good will of God, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> to the contrary, he ſhould reſign to the <hi>Gibeonites the</hi> 7 <hi>Sons of</hi> Saul, though innocent of their Fathers Crimes, to loſe their lives. Therefore his Majeſty, without any kind of Miracle, Oracle, Revelatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Inſpiration, or any viſible Judgement inducing him, may for the ſin of others, long ſince repented, or at leaſt pardoned by Articles, reſign over, and for ever alſo, to ſuch men as this Perſon of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and his Aſſociates are, the Rights, Eſtates, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritances of above ſeventy thouſand innocent Children, and Children unqueſtionably innocent, and Children to Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers too, that fighting as became loyal Subjects, did through Gods permiſſion thereby make themſelves, and theſe their Children ſo miſerable as they are known to be at preſent, and to have been thoſe ten years paſt; And his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty not only may, but ought to do ſo. And not only may,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:38030:74"/> or ought not to regard the condition of Innocency, or the juſtice of publick Articles of Peace, or the Laws of God or Nations in this Caſe, but even to forget his never to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Clemency to a million of other Children, and Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren to Parents guilty of more atrocious <hi>Rebellions,</hi> than the moſt frequently, or moſt obſtinately guilty of theſe <hi>Iriſh</hi> Childrens Fathers.</p>
            <p n="166">166. Behold, Reader, the Argument contained in that rare Antitheſis. And if this be not Logick out of Schools, and Divinity out of Hell, I confeſs I know not what it may be. But this Perſon of Quality will perhaps defend both with his <hi>Engliſh Intereſt,</hi> and his Proteſtant Religion, though I am perſwaded he could ſometimes have ſhaken hands for his own Intereſt, and his own Religion, with the moſt diſloyal <hi>Genevians</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and thrive there too, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them.</p>

            <p n="167">167. I am inclinable to believe there is nothing of <hi>Zeal,</hi> as this Gentleman gives it, in that paſſage, or any other of theſe <hi>Inſtructions,</hi> not that I think it had been improper to ſuch as had been reduced to the ſtraights the Confederates were in then, although ſome of themſelves brought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and all the reſt to ſuch, even by a very unlawful rejection of the firſt Peace in 46. But that I know my ſelf, thoſe of the ſupreme Council was then, to have been of this perſwaſion, that no <hi>Zeal</hi> of Religion could warrant before
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:38030:74"/> God or Man the juſtice of raiſing Armes againſt the Prince, Magiſtrate, or Laws: And that I know the Commiſſioners ſent by the Confederates to <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Dublin,</hi> pleaded al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes the neceſſity was put upon them by the Lords Juſtices, even for the ſafety of their lives, to take Armes. Beſides this Gentleman, who is curious enough in diſtinguiſhing material words (related unto) by a different Character from the <hi>Roman,</hi> that is by <hi>Italick</hi> Letters, omitted to give ſo here that word <hi>Zeal,</hi> albeit the only word was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial above all the reſt there, which yet he delivers in <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique,</hi> as part of that third Inſtruction. And this partly too makes me ſuſpect it, as a pretty additional invention, of purpoſe to parallel the <hi>Zeal</hi> of <hi>Saul</hi> in killing the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> which I ſaid in my Letter could not divert the wrath of God incenſed againſt <hi>Saul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="168">168. But whether it be ſo or no, or whether this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman relates thoſe Inſtructions truly or not, it matters not, being the conteſt is not indeed material, and that he diſputes againſt me, whoſe conſtant belief is (even as part of Catholick Doctrine, clearly delivered in the Scriptures, and in the Fathers, and would this Gentleman's, and his Party's perſwaſion were ſo too) that <hi>no Zeal in Religion can apologize for any kind of Rebellion,</hi> much leſs for <hi>unparal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel'd Murthers,</hi> or <hi>often breaches againſt Nature, or againſt ſtipulation</hi> committed therein, or indeed for any murther at all, or any one even ſingle breach of a juſt promiſe.</p>
            <p n="169">169. Yet I muſt diſſent from this Gentleman in two things he ſays here: And muſt affirm again, becauſe he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes me again, That even thoſe very horrid murthers, (and be they as numerous too, as he will have them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by a very few of the rude rabble amongſt the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> are not only not <hi>unparalleld</hi> in Hiſtories of former ages, and <note place="margin">Pag. 93.</note> other Countries, and by very many inſtances, but not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the Hiſtory of our own days, or that of <hi>England,</hi> ſince the prodigious murther committed on the Scaffold at <hi>Whitehall</hi> by thoſe that ſhaked hands all along with this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman's Clyents. And that all thoſe <hi>Iriſh</hi> murthers, even quinteſſenced into one, have been unqueſtionably not ſo little hainous comparatively as parallel'd, but even as over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallel'd
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:38030:75"/> by that only one; yea had the Actors in it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted no more, as yet they are known to have ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand before and after. And I muſt affirm, that although it be confeſſedly true, that <hi>no zeal in Religion</hi> can apologize for the ſins either Perſonal or National of my Countrymen, as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (if not rather much leſs) for thoſe yet more hideous, and more abominable crimes of ſome of this Perſon of Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty's Brethren; yet both he, and I too, (if Chriſtians, if ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional men) cannot but affirm alſo, That a Godly repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, with all due circumſtances of it, according to the Religion and Faith of God, taught us in the Word of God, may for the time to come, <hi>hinder the effects of Gods Juſtice on my Countrymen,</hi> even thoſe very effects which this <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Quality</hi> wiſheth from his very Soul (I am ſure) that no <note place="margin">Pag. 93.</note> godlineſs may hinder, and which he no leſs poſitively de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces than if he had the mercy of God in his power, and the knowledge of Gods decrees, or of all future contingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies reveal'd to him. But he is neither a Prophet, nor the Son of a Prophet, if I may gueſs. And what ever he be, 'tis like he hath neither the Mercy nor the Juſtice and power of God at his devotion more, nor the knowledge of Gods eternal or temporary pleaſure (concerning my Countrymen) more certainly revealed to him, than the Prophet <hi>Jonas</hi> had all of them together, in relation to the <hi>Ninivites.</hi> And therefore notwithſtanding this Gentleman's prediction here, of, or againſt the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> be ſo poſitive, ſo abſolute an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion of the effects of Gods Juſtice to fall upon them here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, <hi>viz.

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:38030:75"/> and with faith and hope cryed unto him for mercy. And I believe my Countrymen may imitate them, and hope they will.</p>

Nor can he charge any of all their Communion with that wicked Maxim in any kind of ſenſe, that may not be returned on himſelf again with very much diſadvantage to his party.

And whether they have not all that while taught, all of them, and practiced too, a moſt impious Rebellion, partly to introduce the very worſt Religion in the World, and partly, to have none at all? Nay, whether they have not taught, and practiced alſo, that infernal Doctrine of meer deſign, firſt to ruine Monarchy, and then Prelacy, and after theſe Magiſtracy and Miniſtery both in general, could they drive on their deſign; and ſo devour the Tythes, and then pull down the Steeple-houſes (for ſo the Saints did name all Churches) and, in a word, ſet Hell wide open upon the face of the Earth, and make themſelves the ſole Maſters of it, yea abſolute Lords of all the good things in it: of all other mens fortunes, and lives too, and at their own pleaſure waſh their hands in the blood of the wicked, as they term all honeſt men, becauſe not of their cabal? And if this Doctrine, and this Practice be not incomparably worſe than that which (though wickedly) teacheth by word or example, <hi>to do evill that good may come of it;</hi> nay if it lead not by the hand <hi>to do</hi> many great <hi>evills,</hi> that many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet farr greater, yea all imaginable <hi>evills</hi> in the world

            <p n="176">176. But foraſmuch as our Perſon of Quality's malice to the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and Catholicks in general, is known to be ſuch, that he will make uſe of any thing, how weak and inſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant ſoever, to give ſome colour of Juſtice, or ſome right, or ſome title at leaſt to enact or continue this <hi>Transplantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> ſo unmercifull, and becauſe I doubt not he will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to abuſe thoſe that will believe him, with a pretext of ſome exchange, or ſome bargain made by the <hi>Iriſh</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, when they were thrown out of their own habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and put to <hi>Conaght,</hi> and the proprietors of, or dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers in ſuch lands in <hi>Conaght</hi> as were aſſigned to the reſt of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> were likewiſe conſtrained to flit; You (good Reader) may be pleaſed to obſerve,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That of twenty or thirty, nay I may ſay, thirty and twice thirty thouſand <hi>Iriſh</hi> Proprietors, not one thouſand of all, or near a thouſand received the leaſt kind of compenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not ſo much as one foot of land, either in <hi>Conaght</hi> or <hi>Clare,</hi> or elſewhere from the Tyrants, or from any elſe ſince their time.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the twentieth part, nay the fortieth of thoſe

            <p n="3">3. That we know ſome of thoſe had not above ten pound Lands <hi>per annum</hi> aſſigned them in <hi>Conaght,</hi> whoſe proper Eſtates at home in their own Countries, whence they had been ſo removed, were worth a thouſand a year.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That in caſe a bargain could be alleged here, as it can not; and although it be true that a bargain is a bargain; yet it is likewiſe true, that a forced bargain is ſtill a forced bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and not, <hi>ſimply or properly speaking,</hi> any bargain at all, when it is betwixt Subjects, or twixt a Loyal Subject and a Rebel, or with an uſurping Tyrannical Traytor, that by plain force and ſtarving, and threats of exile and death, put in execution on ſome to terrifie others, and ſignified to all by open Proclamation, and really ſo intended for all, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torts from his fellow Subjects ſuch a bargain. And that he muſt be a very bad Chriſtian, and a very bad Subject, and of very little honeſty or reaſon, that would perſwade the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Prince to confirm ſuch bargains, when he can otherwiſe chooſe, and when ſuch bargains (were there any ſuch) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late unto a caſe as ours at preſent is, where ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, where a whole Nation of his good Subjects muſt be loſt for ever by a general <hi>Tranſplantation</hi> of them all, enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by law, or continued otherwiſe, and upon ſuch grounds, and even to gratifie ſuch people, as both invented and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted it.</p>

               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:38030:81"/> 5. That as well others that received ſuch inconſiderable aſſignments of land in <hi>Connaght,</hi> and others too that got no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all, and yet were tranſplanted thither, allege all for themſelves, that manifeſt violence, force, neceſſity put upon them, as well by turning them out of their own houſes and lands, and fleecing them of all their goods, monies, and ſtocks, and ſo reducing them to a ſtarving condition, by hunger, and cold, as by the <hi>Proclamation</hi> (which I have before given, treating of this very ſame ſubject, in another part of this book) <hi>for tranſplanting,</hi> and (which is more) <hi>for ſuing out Decrees in the Courts of Athlone,</hi> and both at their <hi>higheſt peril,</hi> and by the rigorous execution of that <hi>Proclamation,</hi> (the long impriſonment of ſome, and the exile of others, and the death of <hi>Hedrington</hi> in the Market-place at <hi>Dublin,</hi> for not obeying it, as the Paper on his breaſt, when he was executed, expreſſing the Cauſe of his death, did manifeſt) and by the general rule ſo well known, they had to force the obedience of all the <hi>Iriſh</hi> to that <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, Turning them to the</hi> Barbados, or <hi>putting them to death,</hi> expreſſed in plain Engliſh at <hi>Killkenny,</hi> by Colonel <hi>Axtel</hi> in the caſe of Mrs. <hi>Martha Harpoll.</hi>

            <p n="6">6. That how-ever this be, all the tranſplanted <hi>Iriſh</hi> to a man, at leaſt, the generality of them, (and hereof I am very certain) deny any kind of exchange or bargain made by them for ſuch lands, in lieu of their own proper Eſtates, or any releaſe given, or evidences delivered, or diſclaim made, or writings drawn, or promiſe engaged to quit from thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth, or at any time after, their own former titles to thoſe Eſtates, whence they had been ſo forcibly removed. And likewiſe deny, that they could, if they would, prejudice or bind thoſe of their children, who had, by ancient, or late agreements, before the Wars, thoſe very Eſtates entayled upon them.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Finally, that if there be any law in <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Ireland</hi> that in the letter may ſeem to confirm bargains of ſuch a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as binding, were there, I ſay, any bargains at all of what nature ſoever, relating to the generality of the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted <hi>Iriſh,</hi> or to the right of tranſplanting them; or if there be any law, which in the Letter ſeems to intitle his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty

            <head>AN APPENDIX.</head>
            <p>LONG after this Reply had been finiſhed, I heard ſome other Perſons of great Quality, and Perſons too whom I very much eſteem, defend by way of Argument, that the King is not bound at all to perform the Articles of 48. not even to any part, or as much as to one indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual Perſon of the former Confederates of <hi>Ireland,</hi> I mean the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks. And becauſe theſe Perſons of Quality (and whom I otherwiſe hold to be really Men of Honour and Conſcience) did not then, nor for ought I know, could then, or at any other time before, or after (ſince the very firſt time the Caſe was clearly diſputed before his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and ſo many printed Papers and Books came out on both ſides) allege other Argument to juſtifie this Aſſertion againſt the unfortunate <hi>Iriſh,</hi> but only a Paper found, as written by Sir <hi>Nicholas Plunket,</hi> which might have imported a precedent or deſigned Reſolution of breaking that Peace of 48. And becauſe this is a clear miſtake, and to ſhew evidently that it is, I give here at large, a true and perfect account of that Paper. And beſeech the
<pb facs="tcp:38030:83"/> impartial Reader, as likewiſe thoſe Perſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> of Honour and Conſcience, to conſider how di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable before Men, how ſinful and dangerous in the ſight of God, their advice is, hath been, and ſhall be yet further (if, which God forbid, they chance to continue it) to his Majeſty, for not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming thoſe Articles to any part of the ſaid Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates, though ever ſince unalterably (of their part) obſerving thoſe very Articles. For by the enſuing relation, it will appear, that Paper (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rough draught only or not, whether ſigned or not) was not, in order to, or at the time of the peace of 48. written, or any way relating to this Peace; but verily to the former Peace of 46. as written before this very Peace of 46. was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.</p>
            <p>For in the Year 1646. when the then Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Catholicks of <hi>Ireland</hi> treated of a Peace with his late Majeſties Authority, placed in the Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> then Lord Lieutenant of that Kingdom, there appeared much difficulty in bringing that Treaty to a Concluſion, in regard the ſaid Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Catholicks propoſed for more advantagious Conditions in Religion, than thoſe they could ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain upon that Treaty. Whereupon the Earl of <hi>Glamorgan,</hi> being then in <hi>Ireland,</hi> for carrying on the Concluſion of a Peace, with a general concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, to the furtherance of his late Majeſties ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, did declare unto the then Council of the ſaid Confederate Catholicks, that he had power from his ſaid late Majeſty, to grant unto them ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions in Religion, as they might reaſonably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect. Purſuant to which, Articles were agreed on
<pb facs="tcp:38030:84"/> between the ſaid Earl of <hi>Glamorgan,</hi> and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the ſaid Conſederate Catholicks, in order to their ſatisfaction in matters of Religion. But thoſe Articles were to be ſecret for a time, to avoid the prejudice that the then publiſhing thereof might bring on his Majeſties ſervice. The obſervance of which ſecreſie in thoſe Articles, and the publiſhing of the other Articles, between the Lord Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and the ſaid Catholicks, made ſome to doubt, that the ſaid ſecret Articles would be unſecure. For by the publiſhing of the ſaid other Articles, all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons muſt have returned to their former obedience, and the Lord Lieutenant neither knowing or own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſaid ſecret Articles, there could be little hopes of the performance of them. Which Reaſon induced thoſe who were acquainted with the ſaid ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Articles, to bethink themſelves of ſome expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to render them more ſecure. And thereupon it was concluded, upon the requeſt of ſome of the Clergy, that a motion might alſo be in the general Aſſembly of the Confederate Catholicks for an Order to reaſſume their former Union, if the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles concluded on were not performed, without mentioning the particulars or matters contained in ſuch Articles. Which was done accordingly, and the Order was drawn up in general terms, that might comprehend the ſaid ſecret Articles: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſcovering any thing of the matters therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, or the Party with whom theſe Articles were concluded. After which it happened, that the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Tuam</hi> (to whoſe cuſtody the ſaid ſecret Articles were intruſted) was killed in the County of <hi>Sligo,</hi> and thoſe Articles, found with
<pb facs="tcp:38030:84"/> him, were by that means diſcovered, and made publick, and thereupon the Earl of <hi>Glamorgan</hi> was impriſoned at <hi>Dublin,</hi> for his proceedings in that Matter, and the firſt Peace, concluded in the ſaid Year 1646. became uſeleſs to his Majeſty, and to his Subjects.</p>
            <p>And yet the rough draught of the ſaid Order, as all other the Papers of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Confederate Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, coming to the hands of the late Uſurped Powers, it hath been, on ſome Debates ſince his Majeſties Reſtauration, objected, that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of that rough draught did import a precedent and deſigned Reſolution of the breach of the Peace made in the Year 1648. and ſo that rough draught having no certain date, was made uſe of to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of that laſt Peace. Whereas, in truth, that rough draught, and the Order of the Aſſembly that followed it, was made and intended to relate to the former Peace, concluded in the Year 1646. At which time there could be no thought of the later Peace, made in the Year 1648. But to ſatisfie any indifferent Perſon of the truth of this Aſſertion, let him, if he pleaſe, reſort to the Book of the Entries of Orders, made in the general Aſſembly, in the Year 1646. (which Book is now in the <hi>Crimination-Office</hi> at <hi>Dublin,</hi> but was formerly in the Uſurped Powers hands) where he will find, there is no cauſe to doubt of this truth, and will find himſelf neceſſitated to ſupply the defect of a date in the ſaid rough draught, and reconcile the frivolous Objection raiſed thereon, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the later Peace, concluded in the Year 1648.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:38030:85"/>
            <p> It was likewiſe long, and no leſs than a year and a half, after I had finiſhed the fore-going Reply to the Perſon of Quality, that a Book, entitled <hi>Horae Subſecivae,</hi> Printed at <hi>London</hi> 1664. came to my hands, where I found the Author <hi>D. W.</hi> Pag. 81, and 83. fall fouly upon the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſts, and their Peace of 48. and take it for granted, that <hi>P. W</hi>'s former Writings for that People and Peace have been already <hi>ſo fully refuted,</hi> &amp;c. Which is the reaſon I find my ſelf engaged to add here my brief Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations on what he ſayes. And thus take them Reader.</p>
            <p>That in relation to the taking Armes in the Year 1641. and to the extenuation of the Crimes of thoſe who began firſt, or were after involved in that Quarrel or Inſurrection, the relation given out of the <hi>Brief Narrative,</hi> which you have near the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this Reply, cannot, in my judgement, but ſatisfie any indifferent perſon. That to his bold, temerarious, falſe, ignorant, and impudent Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, Pag. 83. <hi>viz. That the Son</hi> (of our late King of glorious memory) Charles <hi>the</hi> 2. <hi>is not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged in the leaſt, by any Law of God or Man, of War or Nations, to keep any one Particle of the</hi> Iriſh <hi>Articles, made or granted by King</hi> Charles <hi>the Father, in the Year</hi> 1648. There have been ſuch clear and ſatisfactory Anſwers made already, and in ſeveral Inſtances and Occaſions by Mouth, Pen, and Print, ſince his Majeſties happy Reſtauration, that more needs not be ſaid here, ſince this Author alleges nothing for his own ſhameful and ſinful Aſſertion, but an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other only of his own (which we ſhall give here preſently) and ſuch a one too, as convinces him
<pb facs="tcp:38030:85"/> of no leſs ignorance and impudence than the former, if not of more. That beſides we have his Royal Majeſties own judgement in point, <hi>P. the 10th.</hi> of the <hi>Act of Settlement.</hi> Which, now being paſt into a Law, is likewiſe the judgement of a Parliament of <hi>Ireland,</hi> where many of thoſe poſſeſſed of the Eſtates of the former Proprietors (who claim the benefit of the ſaid Articles) do ſit and vote His Majeſties own words, in his gracious Declaration of the <hi>30th.</hi> of <hi>Nov.</hi> 1660. and in the ſaid <hi>Act of Settlement,</hi> are theſe, <hi>We could not but hold our ſelf ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to perform what we owe by that Peace.</hi> And in Page the <hi>11th</hi> ſaith, <hi>That others adviſing or concurring in that Settlement, had a due ſenſe of the Obligations which lay upon his Majeſties Honour and Juſtice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this Author of <hi>Horae ſubſecivae</hi> goes further on, to his Reaſon or Ground for ſooth, that is to his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not only no leſs falſe and impudent, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven farr more pernicious and dangerous, both Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion and Suppoſition therein contained. <hi>An in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terloping uſurping Conquerour diſpeſſeſsed both the Father, and the Son, and alſo thoſe very Popiſh Confederates, with whom thoſe Articles were made, To which Uſurper alſo, thoſe very Catholick Confederates, and their Aſſociates, ſubmitted, owned him, and complyed with him. Then comes the Son, and diſpoſſeſſeth the Uſurper again, and recovers</hi> Ireland, <hi>as it were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And therefore King</hi> Charles <hi>the</hi> 2. <hi>may,</hi> Jure
<pb facs="tcp:38030:86"/> Belli, &amp; Gentium, &amp; Lege Talionis (for theſe too, are this very Author's own words, a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to wit, <hi>Pag.</hi> 81.) <hi>without breach of Faith, or Articles (not excepting thoſe of</hi> 1648. <hi>ſo much inſiſted on, and ſo mightily pleaded for by</hi> P.

               </gap>ery) <hi>by that just Law (ſo often uſed and preſcribed by God himſelf) take the Lives and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of all thoſe blood-thirſty Popiſh Rebells, and their Confederates, and Aſsociaies,</hi> &amp;c. So, and in ſuch terms, this moderate, knowing Author ſtates the Caſe of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and gives his Opinion, without any other kind of reaſon than what you ſee here, nay without once mentioning, much leſs ſolving even any one Argument to the contrary, or once ſeeming to doubt of the known falſity, of not only one, but of many of his Suppoſitions, involved in the Antecedent of ſuch a Conſequent, or the falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Premiſſes of ſo wicked a Concluſion. But he muſt give me leave to unſeel his eyes, if himſelf will not, or at leaſt to undeceive thee, good Reader, if any way prepoſſeſſed by this Gentleman's, either bare Aſſertion, or by his ſtating of the Caſe. For in lieu of his willful Omiſſions, and falſe Suppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in his ſtating of it, I muſt give you theſe known truths, That the ſaid rebellious Subjects (ſo ſtyled) before the Uſurping Conquerour diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed either the Father, or the Son, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to their former Obedience, and accepted, own'd, and govern'd, as ſuch, by his Majeſty, and his Father of glorious memory, and fought both the Father and Sons Cauſe, therein loſt their blood and fortunes, and never ſubmitted to the ſaid Uſurped Authority, till they were over-pow'red, and forced
<pb facs="tcp:38030:86"/> thereunto. That when they could not reſiſt any longer the tyranny of the Uſurper, many thouſands of them followed the Son's fortune in forein parts, and there inliſted themſelves under his Enſignes. And that ſuch as ſtayed at home, never made any Conditions with the Uſurpers, till they were licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſo to do by the Son. This being the full and true ſtate of the Caſe, it is to be conſidered, Whether, on the whole matter, the Son be obliged to perform the ſaid Articles? I ſay he is, both by the Law of God and Man, by the Laws of War and Nations: becauſe Promiſes, Pacts, or Agreements, in things lawful, or that are not ſinful, even betwixt Kings and their Subjects, whether at any time Rebells or not, are binding by all theſe Laws, as I have my ſelf at large evidenced, partly in this Reply, and partly in my Printed Letter, and <hi>Iriſh Colours Folded,</hi> and others have more amply, in ſeveral occaſions, and his Majeſty, whoſe teſtimony and authority is above all exception, moſt graciouſly and truly declares, in his publick Act of Settlement, as we have now ſeen. That what this Trifling Author of <hi>Horae ſubſecivae,</hi> objects, of <hi>an interloping Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,</hi> &amp;c. makes no alteration in the Caſe. For, 1. I muſt tell this Gentleman, he doth no leſs igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly, than improperly, ſtyle the ſucceſs of the Uſurper a Conqueſt, or him a Conquerer. The raiſing of Armes by Subjects againſt their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, had never yet any name in <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> or in the Laws of either, but Rebellion and Treaſon. And the effects of Treaſon and Rebellion can never be termed properly or truly a Conqueſt, nor the prevailing Traytor a Conquerour. For that
<pb facs="tcp:38030:87"/> were to give a Right and Title that might paſs to the Traytor's Poſterity in ſucceſſion. 2. That <hi>Charles</hi> the 2. (whom God preſerve) and his Father, are looked on by this Author, and by this Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as diſpoſſeſs'd by the Uſurper. Which is plain ignorance, or at leaſt a willful and malicious miſtake of the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> which ſo preſerve the Poſſeſſions of the Crown, as the King cannot be diſpoſſeſſed by a Subject. A Subject may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude, and take the profits of the Land belonging to the King. But this, in Law, can never amount to the diſpoſſeſſing of the King. Where-ever <hi>Charles</hi> the 2. was the <hi>30th.</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> in the Year 1648. being the fatal day of his Father's death, <hi>eo inſtanti</hi> he began his Reign: and therefore now is the 16. Year thereof. Whereas, if he could be diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd of his Crown by his rebellious Subjects, and that horrid Action could be ſtyled a Conqueſt, and his regaining thereof again, a new Conqueſt, this ſhould be but the fourth Year of his Reign. And who ſees not, it were a very ill exchange for his Majeſty, to forgoe his antient and undoubted Right to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and to own his holding and enjoyment thereof by Conqueſt on an Uſurper, who could pretend no right thereunto? 3. That, that his ground (of his former bold, impious, and bloody Aſſertion, or after-concluſion thence deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) of <hi>an interloping uſurping Conquerour,</hi> if admitted for ſound or ſolid, for good or true Doctrine, might prove very diſadvantagious and injurious to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Subjects in general, <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scots,</hi> of what Religion ſoever, no leſs than <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſts, even, I ſay, in their Eſtates, Liberties, and Lives. For if
<pb facs="tcp:38030:87" rendition="simple:additions"/> a King come even to a Chriſt an Kingdom by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, he hath <hi>Vitae &amp; Necis poteſtatem.</hi> He may at his pleaſure alter and change the Laws of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; as appears in <hi>Cook l.</hi> 7. <hi>Report, Calamy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s Caſe.</hi> 4. That he falſly charges the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſts, to have own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Uſuprer, as I have (a little above) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared. 5. That he doth as falſly and ignorantly, or at leaſt out of deſigned malice, and againſt his own Conſcience, averr, That the <hi>Civilians</hi> have, in like Caſes, long ſince decided this Caſe of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> truly ſtated, as I have above, or any way decided for him, that of <hi>an interloping uſurping Conquerour,</hi> &amp;c. applyed to <hi>Charles</hi> the 2. and his good Subjects, whether <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, Scots,</hi> or <hi>Iriſh,</hi> even, I mean, thoſe very <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſts that formerly had been Confederates, and after ſubmitted to his Majeſty, or his Father, upon Articles, fought conſtantly for him, and under his Banner, and by his Commiſſion, againſt the Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and never ſubmitted ſince to any other Power whatſoever, but with his ſaid Majeſties own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. If this Gentleman can allege but even one <hi>Civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> for himſelf, even, I ſay, in this Caſe of his, or any other ſuch <hi>interloping uſurping Conquerour,</hi> truly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, I will grant him ſomewhat to excuſe his no leſs inhumane, than unchariſtian, and moſt horrid Aſſertion. But I am confident all his malice cannot find one, whom he dares quote in writing or print. So farr doth he ſpeak, as out of all reaſon, ſo out of all Books. 6. That by conſequence, neceſſary follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the obligation of publick Agreements, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> cannot be puniſhed by the King, as this Author ſayes they may, <hi>Lege Talionis,</hi> no more than he can, by any other Law (as is before ſhewed) of God or Man, War or Nations. For the King hath already bound
<pb facs="tcp:38030:88"/> his own hands from acting againſt them, by retalia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or otherwiſe, &amp; acknowledges himſelf to be ſo bound in honour and juſtice, according (I mean) to thoſe Articles of 48. and to ſuch as cannot be proved to have, by after diſobedience, or ſiding with an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, forfeited them.</p>
            <p>And ſo I bid this learned, honeſt, prudent Author of <hi>Horaeſubſecivae</hi> adieu, and to his impertinent refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions on this ſubject, and my ſelf. And will only add this to thee, judicious Reader, to be conſidered, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be not agreeable to all juſtice and equity, that thoſe who loſt their lives and fortunes in aſſerting his Majeſties Cauſe, as they have been loſers, and afflicted with him, and for him too, in his adverſity, ought not, in theſe dayes of his Majeſties power and proſperity, regain thereby their loſt fortunes, eſpecially where the Publick Faith was engaged for their reſtitution.</p>
            <p>As for that ſcruple, which, peradventure, ſome may think uncleared as yet, of ſome few, or even many of thoſe Articling Papiſts of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to have forfeited the benefit of thoſe Articles, and not for themſelves alone, but even for all the reſt of their Countrymen, though not in their own perſons guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of any ſuch breach, as thoſe were, or any at all: And for the ground or reaſon alleged by ſome for this ſcruple, <hi>viz.</hi> That by the prevarication of thoſe few or many, whether the greater or leſſer part of that People, whether the Repreſentatives of the whole or nor, the Kings end in granting thoſe Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles was fruſtrated, foraſmuch as thereby it happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he could not carry on his main Deſign then againſt the Uſurpers: And as for that too, which is further alleged to this purpoſe, or for the illuſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:38030:88"/> of it, and further grounding of that ſcruple, That if a Garriſon be diſmiſſed out of a Town, upon cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Articles of War, to be freely and ſafely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed to their own Quarters or General, and that any part of them break any of theſe Articles, which they were to obſerve at their peril, the whole num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber have forfeited their right to any ſuch free paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, or ſafe convey, and are at the mercy of the Conquerour: It is anſwer'd, That the End, by either ſide propoſed to themſelves in making a Peace, or Articles, being fruſtrated, doth not invalidate ſuch Peace, or Articles, unleſs ſuch End be in thoſe Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles expreſſed, and further clear expreſs caution in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted in the Agreement, that otherwiſe it ſhall be void. Elſe, I pray, what Stipulation, Pact, Agreement, or Peace on Earth, can hold, or oblige either ſide? And for that Example of a Garriſon Town, or Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, capitulating on Articles of War, its anſwered, The condition of Subjects, enjoying the benefit and protection of the Laws, is fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ir lives, and that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the crime or breach of ſome, but in ſome caſes without any ſuch crime or breach, by any of them: But a juſt King cannot ſo carry himſelf towards his own Subjects, whom he doth once own as ſuch, and as ſuch to be protected and governed by his Laws, as other free-born Subjects. For ſuch he cannot without injuſtice puniſh for the Diſobedience, Breach, or Rebellion of any other, leſſer, or even greater part of their fellow Subjects, whether theſe repreſent the whole body of his Subjects or not, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they fruſtrate or not his beſt Deſignes, and his
<pb facs="tcp:38030:89" rendition="simple:additions"/> greateſt, moſt glorious, and juſt Enterprizes, or nor. Otherwiſe what ſhould become, according to ſuch Law and Juſtice, I ſpeak, of all the good Subjects of <hi>England, Ireland, Scotland,</hi> if the King pleaſed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed according to that rigour of Juſtice againſt them, when he was re-inthroned? Nay, what ſhould become of all other good Subjects of any Prince or State on Earth, 'gainſt whom there have been ſuch frequent Rebellions? Beſides it is againſt the true meaning of all Laws Divine and Humane, that a Judge or Prince doing Juſtice to his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ubjects in a legal way, not by force of Armes, ſhould involve the Innocent in the guilt or puniſhment of the Nocent. And therefore it is plain, that neither that Scruple, Reaſon of it, nor Example or Similitude brought to ſtrengthen it, can make any thing for them, that would thence conclude the King is wholly free from any Obligation, to any part of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Catholicks, ariſing from the Articles of 48. They have been, ſince that Peace of 48, Subjects, not Enemies: And thoſe Articles had not any ſuch Clauſe inſerted, that in caſe any part, leſſer or greater, Repreſentatives or not, ſhould break the Conditions, the reſt ſhould likewiſe forfeit: and the End fruſtrated, doth not make them to forfeit,</p>
